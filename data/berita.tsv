<p>Ethereum cofounder Vitalik <strong>Buterin declared 2026 to be the “year we take back lost ground in computing self-sovereignty,” </strong>starting with his own devices. </p>

<p><a href=""https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/019be9d1-f027-774d-b5da-a014646e.jpg?itok=wCpSSFC6""><img alt="""" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" height=""333"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/019be9d1-f027-774d-b5da-a014646e.jpg?itok=wCpSSFC6"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>In a Friday <a href=""https://x.com/vitalikbuterin/status/2014454477152256415?s=46&amp;t=H3mqKGOatz3BS5Loh_-Y6g"">post</a> on X, he laid out the software changes he has made to reduce reliance on data-hungry, centralized platforms.</p>

<p><strong>The “two major changes” to the software he used in 2025 were switching “almost fully” to Fileverse,</strong> an <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-open-source-protocols-and-how-do-they-work"">open-source</a>, decentralized document platform — a kind of privacy-preserving Google Docs — <strong>and switching “decisively” to Signal</strong> as his primary messaging app.</p>

<p>Signal uses end-to-end <a href=""https://cybercitadel.com/signal-vs-telegram-a-detailed-comparison-of-security-and-privacy/"">encryption</a> by default for all one-to-one and group chats, and stores minimal metadata, meaning only limited information, such as when an account was created or the last date it connected to the service.</p>

<p>Telegram, in contrast, only offers end-to-end encryption in optional “secret chats” and otherwise keeps messages and metadata on its own servers, a model that has drawn scrutiny as <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/telegram-ceo-pavel-durov-france-travel-ban-lifted"">law enforcement data requests</a> have increased in countries like France.</p>

<h2>Local AI and self-hosted tools</h2>

<p>In 2026, Buterin has moved from Google Maps to OpenStreetMap via OrganicMaps and from Gmail to Proton Mail, while <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-buterin-decentralized-social-media-2026-priority"">prioritizing decentralized social media</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Buterin also discussed his experiments with locally hosting large language models, arguing that sending all data to third-party services is “unnecessary” when users can increasingly run artificial intelligence tools on their own hardware. </strong></p>

<p>He said better user interfaces, integrations and efficiency are still needed to make local models a seamless default, but added that there has already been “huge progress” compared with a year ago. </p>

<h2>Privacy advocates see broader shift</h2>

<p>His post echoes points made by privacy advocate and NBTV founder Naomi Brockwell, who described running models locally as the most private way to use AI without sending prompts or documents to external servers.</p>

<p><a href=""https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/019be9dc-1961-79ac-9a3e-aebc018f.jpg?itok=hVcN6G6w""><img alt="""" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" height=""545"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/019be9dc-1961-79ac-9a3e-aebc018f.jpg?itok=hVcN6G6w"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p><em>How to use AI privately. Source: </em><a href=""https://x.com/naomibrockwell/status/2013315333428236636""><em>Naomi Brockwell</em></a></p>

<p>Brockwell has spent years teaching privacy-enhancing behavior to mainstream audiences, arguing that privacy is about autonomy rather than secrecy and encouraging the use of tools like Bitcoin, encrypted messengers and self-hosted services to reduce government and corporate surveillance power.</p>

<p><strong>Buterin’s post also comes amid renewed debate over how much access governments and platforms should have to users’ private communications and metadata.</strong></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/eu-chat-control-regulation-advances-encryption-privacy-debate"">European Union’s controversial Chat Control proposal</a>, for example, originally included pre‑encryption scanning of messages to detect abusive material, and prompted warnings from civil liberties groups and technologists that client‑side scanning could undermine trust in encrypted apps.</p>

<p>Progressively swapping out everyday apps for encrypted, open-source and local alternatives is, according to Buterin and other privacy advocates, one way for users to start reclaiming control over their data flows.</p>

<p><strong>""Signal-Gate"" continues to erupt out of Minneapolis</strong>, as the organizational structure or command-and-control nodes of left-wing activists operating within encrypted messaging apps were infiltrated and exposed on Sunday, revealing that on-the-ground pressure campaigns against federal agents were highly coordinated and, according to some experts, exhibit characteristics of a ""low-level insurgency.""</p>

<p><strong>What is especially concerning</strong> is that the federal government was unable to identify the command-and-control communication structures behind these pressure campaigns in the sanctuary city, while citizen journalists were the ones who ultimately uncovered the bombshell.</p>

<p>*   *   *  </p>

<p><strong>What appears to be unfolding in Minneapolis</strong>, particularly following the emergence of ""<a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/political/left-wing-activists-run-quasi-police-operation-signal-target-ice-agents-minneapolis"">Signal-Gate</a>"" on Sunday via citizen journalists on X, <strong>extends well beyond any conventional protest activity</strong>. The evidence so far suggests coordinated pressure campaigns against federal agents exhibiting characteristics of a low-level insurgency, <strong>with direction, tasking, and information flow routed through encrypted messaging apps,</strong> implying an organized command-and-control structure functioning as a shadow revolutionary force.</p>

<p>Higby suggested that left-wing activist networks are leveraging local residents as force multipliers in coordinated pressure campaigns against federal agents, forming pressure campaigns that one military analyst characterized as <strong>""What's unfolding in Minneapolis right now isn't 'protest."" It's low-level insurgency infrastructure, built by people who've clearly studied the playbook.""</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>The encrypted Signal messages obtained by Fox News Digital in real time show that anti-ICE ""rapid responders"" were actively tracking</strong>, broadcasting and summoning ""backup"" around federal agents outside Glam Doll Donuts on Nicollet Avenue, where the shooting happened. Local ""rapid responders"" made at least 26 entries into a database called ""MN ICE Plates"" in the critical hours before and after the killing, documenting the license plate numbers and details of alleged ICE vehicles they claimed to see around Nicollet Avenue.</em></p>

<p>First, Eric Schwalm, a retired U.S. Army Special Forces Green Beret who held the rank of Chief Warrant Officer 4, offered his assessment of events unfolding in Minneapolis.</p>

<p>Schwalm described the command-and-control dynamics operating within left-wing activist Signal groups as a form of <strong>""low-level insurgency infrastructure,"" noting it appears to be created by individuals who have clearly studied and internalized the insurgency playbook.</strong></p>

<p>Schwalm continued:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>As a former Special Forces Warrant Officer with multiple rotations running counterinsurgency ops—both hunting insurgents and trying to separate them from sympathetic populations—I've seen organized resistance up close. From Anbar to Helmand, the pattern is familiar: spotters, cutouts, dead drops (or modern equivalents), disciplined comms, role specialization, and a willingness to absorb casualties while bleeding the stronger force slowly.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>What's unfolding in Minneapolis right now isn't ""protest."" It's low-level insurgency infrastructure, built by people who've clearly studied the playbook.</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Signal groups at 1,000-member cap per zone. Dedicated roles: mobile chasers, plate checkers logging vehicle data into shared databases, 24/7 dispatch nodes vectoring assets, SALUTE-style reporting (Size, Activity, Location, Unit, Time, Equipment) on suspected federal vehicles. Daily chat rotations and timed deletions to frustrate forensic recovery. Vetting processes for new joiners. Mutual aid from sympathetic locals (teachers providing cover, possible PD tip-offs on license plate lookups). Home-base coordination points. Rapid escalation from observation to physical obstruction—or worse.</em></p>

<p><em>This isn't spontaneous outrage. This is C2 (command and control) with redundancy, OPSEC hygiene, and task organization that would make a SF team sergeant nod in recognition. Replace ""ICE agents"" with ""occupying coalition forces"" and the structure maps almost 1:1 to early-stage urban cells we hunted in the mid-2000s.</em></p>

<p><em>The most sobering part? It's domestic. Funded, trained (somewhere), and directed by people who live in the same country they're trying to paralyze law enforcement in. When your own citizens build and operate this level of parallel intelligence and rapid-response network against federal officers—complete with doxxing, vehicle pursuits, and harassment that's already turned lethal—you're no longer dealing with civil disobedience. You're facing a distributed resistance that's learned the lessons of successful insurgencies: stay below the kinetic threshold most of the time, force over-reaction when possible, maintain popular support through narrative, and never present a single center of gravity.</em></p>

<p><em>I spent years training partner forces to dismantle exactly this kind of apparatus. Now pieces of it are standing up in American cities, enabled by elements of local government and civil society. That should keep every thinking American awake at night.</em></p>

<p><em>Not because I want escalation. But because history shows these things don't de-escalate on their own once the infrastructure exists and the cadre believe they're winning the information war.</em></p>

<p><em>We either recognize what we're actually looking at—or we pretend it's still just ""activism"" until the structures harden and spread.</em></p>

<p><em>Your call, America. But from where I sit, this isn't January 2026 politics anymore. It's phase one of something we've spent decades trying to keep off our own soil.</em></p>

<p><strong>The key informational gap citizen journalists face is who exactly is providing the organizational know-how</strong> required to coordinate these operations across Minneapolis via encrypted messaging platforms. There are reports that Antifa, government officials, gang members, journalists, and others were in the group, but the <strong>structure observed is well-disciplined, scalable, and purpose-built to disrupt federal deportation operations</strong>.

<p>If this movement is assessed as a communist revolutionary effort, and if the seasoned special forces expert is viewing it as more of a ""low-level insurgency"", then the current characterization as a civil rights protest or democratic activism is a misdiagnosis of the actual threat - one that we've labeled is a <strong>color-revolution-style operation being waged from the left-wing NGO sphere against President Trump</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>The big question</strong> is why mainstream Democratic leaders have remained largely silent as left-wing revolutionaries operate within their party under the guise of ""democracy"" or whatever the most trending cause is. The mobilizing narrative has shifted repeatedly, from George Floyd to pro-Palestinian activism, and now to anti-ICE. Just wait until spring; the revolutionaries want chaos - and Democrats are completely fine with this. </p>

	2026-01-26	ZeroHedge (Markets)	What We Are Experiencing Is Not De-Dollarisation But De-Fiatization	https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/what-we-are-experiencing-not-de-dollarisation-de-fiatization	"<span class=""field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden"">What We Are Experiencing Is Not De-Dollarisation But De-Fiatization</span>

            <div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p><em>By Benjamin Picton, Senior Market Strategist At Rabobank</em></p>

<p><strong>J.P. Morgan once famously remarked that “gold is money, everything else is credit.” </strong>That dictum was apparently forgotten during the 1980s & 1990s as gold’s share of central bank reserves steadily declined and gold prices – for most of that period – did the same.</p>

<p>That period was the most recent era of high financialization, where Hollywood movies like Wall Street, Trading Places, Barbarians at the Gate and even Pretty Woman glorified the swashbuckling lifestyle of financiers. It was also the era of the leveraged buyout, the rise of the MBA, the retail day-trader speculating in the dotcom boom and the germination of the idea (in the Anglosphere, at least) that you too can get rich through landlording – effectively transforming housing from a consumption good to a financial asset. This was also the era of the imperialism of the US Treasury Bond.</p>

<p>With the benefit of hindsight, it is reasonably clear from the data that this period ended with the popping of the dotcom bubble, but the final eulogy was not read until the financial crisis of 2008 when the <strong>excesses of high financialization were truly laid bare. </strong>This imbued the arguments of non-market economies like China that American system was decadent and sclerotic – and that the their system was superior – with apparent credibility. Along with military misadventure in the Middle East this constituted a heavy blow for the soft power and prestige of the United States.</p>

<p><strong>While it is typical to think of the financial crisis is an epochal ending, gold’s share of central bank reserves hit its nadir around the year 2000. </strong>That was also the approximate highwater mark for US Treasury bonds’ share of global reserve assets. Many Western central banks – the last sellers of scale – had recently offloaded their holdings at low, low prices in the late 1990s having been taken in by fashionable ideas that gold was a “barbarous relic” and that <strong>the creation of the fiat monetary system and floating exchange rates in 1971 made holding gold a quaint anachronism.</strong></p>

<p>Fast forward to today and gold is now trading well above $5000/oz. Silver is trading well above $100/oz. <strong>The financial has given way to the material and the fashionable narrative is now ‘sell America’ and de-Dollarisation. </strong>Dollar assets’ share of total central bank reserves has been in slow decline for years, but some commentators are now pronouncing the death of the Dollar system as Donald Trump’s abrasive style of foreign policy offends traditional allies. <strong>In seeming support of the sell America narrative, the Bloomberg Dollar spot index is down 1.14% year to date.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/gold%20spot_5.jpg?itok=Vf2hf_Ii""><img alt="""" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" height=""284"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/gold%20spot_5.jpg?itok=Vf2hf_Ii"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p><strong>However, on the other side of the ledger we continue to see strong demand at US Treasury auctions and SWIFT data shows that the use of the US Dollar in international payments is actually <em>increasing</em>, mostly at the expense of the Euro</strong>. The Chinese Renminbi has seen a modest rise in its use in payments, but small declines in its already low share of central bank reserves. Even the increased use in payments is exaggerated somewhat by transactions between mainland China and Hong Kong. <strong>At only 3-4% of total payments versus more than 50% for the Dollar, it would seem to us that the demise of the Dollar in favor of other currencies is much exaggerated.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Speaking to the media at Davos, hedge fund manager Ray Dalio argued that what we are experiencing is not de-Dollarisation, but <em>de-fiatization</em>. </strong>That is, flight from fiat currencies in favor of real assets or – as J.P. Morgan might have advised – real money in the form of gold and silver. Ray pointed out that “in a war-like environment” countries don’t want to hold each other’s debt for fear of sanctions (Russia presents a cautionary example), while other investors don’t want to hold financial claims for fear of debasement through deficit spending by national governments and debt monetization – quantitative easing – by central banks. Under this scenario, it is rational to hold neutral money with no counterparty risk, no risk of debasement and less scope for the imposition of capital controls. The last sellers of scale (central banks) became the first buyers of scale in 2024 and 2025, but the trade has broadened out to other buyers.</p>

<p>The debasement of fiat currencies is now easy to spot. <strong>Aside from gold and silver regularly re-setting all-time highs the Bloomberg commodity index has surged to sit at its highest level since mid-2022. </strong>Brent crude prices have risen for the last five weeks straight and Henry Hub natural gas prices have surged more than 65% year-to-date. These types of moves signal a scarcity of the material relative to the financial. Consequently, long yields have remained elevated (or surged, in the case of Japan) and the Reserve Bank of Australia – who took the ‘gently, gently’ approach on fighting inflation – may soon become the first G10 currency-issuing central bank (aside from Japan) forced to hike rates. The AUD has recently been surging in anticipation.</p>

<p><strong>As Dalio explained to Bloomberg, the flipside of a trade imbalance is a capital imbalance.</strong> This is because the capital account is – by definition – the inverse of the current account (which includes the trade balance) in the balance of payments. With the USA running record current account deficits in early 2025, it’s a matter of mathematics that foreign investors have to buy US Treasuries for that deficit to be financed. For the US to make progress on reducing its trade deficit (as it has recently), it must also make progress on reducing its capital account surplus. That means fewer Dollars for the rest of the world who – as detailed above – rely on Dollars to conduct trade.</p>

<p><strong>This is the Triffin Dilemma, which also describes why China – with its immense and growing trade surplus – cannot supplant the Dollar’s global role with the CNY. </strong>How are you going to get CNY into the hands of other countries unless China runs a trade deficit? Logically – though its appeal as a store of value may be diminishing – the Dollar must remain the global reserve currency because there is no viable alternative. <strong>Central governments will not return to a gold standard for the same reason the last vestiges of the gold standard were abandoned in the first place: it would constrain governments’ freedom to engage in deficit spending and create inflation.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Very clearly the world is erecting new barriers to the free movement of goods. </strong>With the US embracing a re-invigorated Monroe Doctrine under its new National Security Strategy, it now views the economic affairs of its neighbours in the Western Hemisphere as issues of interest for the United States. This is obvious in the case of Venezuela, and also in the case of the Panama Canal, and was again highlighted over the weekend when President Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on all Canadian goods if Canada were to do a trade deal with China.</p>

<p>Canadian PM Carney became the darling of Davos by delivering a speech articulating the changes in the world order and attempting to rally middle powers to band together and stand against great power coercion. <strong>Carney was delivering jabs at the United States, but the credibility of his message may have been diminished somewhat by his actions in signing an agreement with China to reduce Canada’s 100% tariff on Chinese EVs in exchange for a reduction in Chinese tariffs on Canadian canola and seafood products.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Speaking to ABC’s This Week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent explained the tariff threat by making it clear that Canada’s deal was not acceptable from the perspective of the USA. </strong>“We have a highly integrated market with Canada... Goods can cross the border six times during the manufacturing process. And we can’t let Canada become an opening that the Chinese pour their cheap goods into the U.S.”</p>

<p>For now, <strong>the geostrategic competition between China and the United States continues to be prosecuted as a trade war but investors may do well to heed Dalio’s warning that punishment in the form of a global capital war is on the horizon. </strong>For details on how one part of that might look, see our thoughts on US Dollar stablecoins <a href=""https://public-eur.mkt.dynamics.com/api/orgs/285245b1-7c6f-ef11-a66d-000d3a4b6c6a/r/2tERuFw7I0CJdWI_nBACAAEAAAA?msdynmkt_target=%7B%22TargetUrl%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Feur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com%252F%253Furl%253Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fpublic-eur.mkt.dynamics.com%25252Fapi%25252Forgs%25252F285245b1-7c6f-ef11-a66d-000d3a4b6c6a%25252Fr%25252F8Hi1mKKC-EOQrAftnAUCAAEAAAA%25253Fmsdynmkt_target%25253D%2525257B%25252522TargetUrl%25252522%2525253A%25252522https%252525253A%252525252F%252525252Fmedia.rabobank.com%252525252Fm%252525252F688b499eb2c84334%252525252Foriginal%252525252Fstablecoins_in_an_unstable_system.pdf%25252522%2525252C%25252522RedirectOptions%25252522%2525253A%2525257B%252525225%25252522%2525253Anull%2525252C%252525221%25252522%2525253Anull%2525252C%252525222%25252522%2525253A%2525257B%25252522utm_medium%25252522%2525253A%25252522email%25252522%2525252C%25252522utm_term%25252522%2525253A%25252522N%2525252FA%25252522%2525252C%25252522utm_source%25252522%2525253A%25252522dynamics-rr%25252522%2525252C%25252522utm_campaign%25252522%2525253A%252525221%25252522%2525257D%2525257D%2525257D%252526msdynmkt_digest%25253Dp5%2525252FGi9tDlGssMQvkUdVP%2525252Fk4aXgvpxhevKFplyK%2525252FcsPc%2525253D%252526msdynmkt_secretVersion%25253D7bb221762d0c46939816d3a5592b1359%2526data%253D05%25257C02%25257Cbenjamin.picton%252540rabobank.com%25257C121f9b0ab6074443fb3208dde0c6cf94%25257C6e93a6268aca4dc19191ce291b4b75a1%25257C0%25257C0%25257C638913866735833724%25257CUnknown%25257CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%25253D%25253D%25257C0%25257C%25257C%25257C%2526sdata%253DmhgMN%25252B1T4WQ2DFz1A6TsNxTxaYwGlxIAAVixWseGSh8%25253D%2526reserved%253D0%22%2C%22RedirectOptions%22%3A%7B%225%22%3Anull%2C%221%22%3Anull%2C%222%22%3A%7B%22utm_medium%22%3A%22email%22%2C%22utm_term%22%3A%22N%2FA%22%2C%22utm_source%22%3A%22dynamics-rr%22%2C%22utm_content%22%3A%22Global%20Daily%3A%20Capital%20Punishment%22%2C%22utm_campaign%22%3A%22SN%3A%20Global%20Daily%3A%20Capital%20Punishm%20a080fd%22%7D%7D%7D&amp;msdynmkt_digest=xdv9XSPrzZnJapukuvtfNemZmEOF3U%2BANTLK77uVNqk%3D&amp;msdynmkt_secretVersion=7bb221762d0c46939816d3a5592b1359"">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>This year, there has been a race to the bottom as Democratic politicians fuel the rage in our streets against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers. </strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/V9oOJzJL67oooLxSOSXHik6CfzdILJfJ.jpg?itok=CGgcO1fH""><img alt="""" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" height=""367"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/V9oOJzJL67oooLxSOSXHik6CfzdILJfJ.jpg?itok=CGgcO1fH"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>That continued this last week when Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz again rushed to judgment after a shooting, adding that the public should not treat Border Patrol or ICE officers as real “law enforcement” officers.</p>

<p><strong>However, rock bottom was finally reached by Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes (D), who not only said that she does not consider ICE officers to be “real law enforcement,” but raised the possibility of citizens shooting them under state law.</strong></p>

<p>First, the obvious.  </p>

<p><strong>Mayes <a href=""https://www.12news.com/video/news/local/12news-exclusive-az-ag-kris-mayes-one-on-one-with-brahm-resnik/75-69f12656-07c4-472e-a9f6-c00410782b27"">said</a>, “I put [“officers”] in air quotes because I don’t think they are real law enforcement.” </strong>These are real law enforcement officers under federal law, enforcing federal law. Period. The effort by Walz, Mayes, and others to question their status or treat them as impostors is clearly designed to inflame citizens and encourage greater confrontations.</p>

<p><strong>It is a dangerous form of demagoguery.</strong> It is sending citizens into harm’s way, encouraging them to impede federal operations involving the arrest of criminal suspects.</p>

<p>Mayes’s comments could justify many putting “attorney general” in air quotes since she is not only misleading citizens about the status of these officers but also enabling the very rage that is causing the injury and death of individuals.</p>

<p>Again, repeating Walz’s talking points, she referred to these officers as “poorly trained.” She obviously has no idea about the training of these officers. The officer involved in the Alex Pretti shooting was an experienced officer with the Border Patrol. The officer involved in the prior Renée Good shooting was also an experienced officer.</p>

<p><strong>While mischaracterizing the officers, figures like Walz are sending demonstrably “untrained” citizens into highly dangerous situations.</strong> Walz specifically called out citizens into the streets to record these operations, which is precisely what Pretti was trying to do before his fatal confrontation with officers.</p>

<p>Mayes, however, was not looking for a tie in that race to the bottom. She told citizens that Arizona’s “Stand Your Ground” law might be cited as grounds for the use of lethal force against officers.  She declared:</p>

<p><em>“You have these masked, federal officers with very little identification — sometimes no identification — wearing plain clothes and masks and we have a ‘Stand Your Ground’ law that says if you reasonably believe your life is in danger and you’re in your house or in your car or on your property, that you can defend yourself with lethal force.”</em></p>

<p>She later added, <em><strong>“It’s a fact that we have a ‘Stand Your Ground’ law and, in other states, un-uniformed, masked people who can’t be identified as police officers.”</strong></em></p>

<p>It was a reckless statement of the law.</p>

<p><strong>These laws only protect “reasonable” uses of self-defense.</strong> However, they have an <a href=""https://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/00404.htm"">express exemption</a> for using force “to resist an arrest that the person knows or should know is being made by a peace officer or by a person acting in a peace officer’s presence and at his direction, whether the arrest is lawful or unlawful, unless the physical force used by the peace officer exceeds that allowed by law.”</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for law enforcement to use officers in plain clothes to make initial arrests or contacts with suspects who might flee or resist.</p>

<p><strong>Mayes’s comments could encourage an already enraged and irrational segment of our population to use lethal force under the false pretense of standing their ground.</strong></p>

<p>Attacks on these officers have increased exponentially with the violent rhetoric of these politicians. Just last week, a rioter<a href=""https://nypost.com/2026/01/24/us-news/unhinged-rioters-face-off-against-feds-as-anger-violence-in-minneapolis-spirals-out-of-control/""> bit off the finger</a> of an officer.</p>

<p>Mayes also vowed to prosecute any ICE agent who violates state laws in these operations. She is also mimicking Walz in spreading legal disinformation. While federal officers do not have absolute immunity in all cases, it is extremely unlikely that state officials could successfully prosecute such cases without facing a transfer to federal court and likely dismissal.</p>

<p>Walz made the same misleading claim in saying that Minnesota would investigate the shooting and that the federal government would not be allowed to conduct the investigation. He has no authority to dictate who or how the shooting will be investigated.</p>

<p>While the state can conduct its own investigation, the federal government will investigate a shooting by a federal officer. Walz further pandered to the mob by raising <a href=""https://thehill.com/opinion/immigration/5703961-clickbait-how-the-left-created-another-false-story-to-trigger-outrage/"">the debunked “bait boy” story</a> and telling citizens that ICE was “shooting them in the face when they come out of donut shops.”</p>

<p>Rage is hard to maintain for months and the Pretti shooting, as described by one Democratic operative <a href=""https://x.com/ChadPergram/status/2015124161669087256"">according to Fox’s Chad Pergram</a>, is a “new wild card” in the politics on the Hill over funding.</p>

<p><strong>There remain legitimate questions about this shooting. </strong>The videotapes do not show, as suggested in early accounts from the federal government, that Pretti approached the officers brandishing a weapon.</p>

<p>Pretti does not obey the commands of the officers in returning to the middle of the road during their operation. However, he did not appear threatening until after the officer pushed him to the side of the road. At one point, he appears to shove the officer as he tries to assist a woman who was pushed to the ground.</p>

<p>What happens next is hard to determine. There is a video that suggests that an officer may have removed his weapon from its holster just before another officer yells “gun.” It is hard to see Pretti’s hands and we do not know what happened in that split second. We may get a better idea as new videotapes emerge.</p>

<p>Law enforcement officers do not expect blind deference on shootings. However, they have a right to expect a fair chance for an investigation to hear their side of a shooting — not a governor or a mayor rushing before cameras to effectively accuse them of murder.</p>

<p><strong>At this point, it may not matter. Only the mob matters.</strong>  Minneapolis Brian O’Hara explained: “even if there is an investigation that ultimately proves that at the time of the shooting it was legally justified, I don’t think that even matters at this point, because there just- there is so much outrage and concern around what is happening in the city.”</p>

<p>Walz has demonstrated politics of the lowest kind, stoking anger as citizens and officers alike are injured. Walz is pledging to go to court to stop further operations—a lawsuit that would be another frivolous filing. Previously, the state, including Attorney General Keith Ellison, filed to prevent the federal government from increasing forces to investigate fraud and immigration violations.</p>

<p><strong>Walz, Mayes, and others are following a long line of demagogues who sought to use social unrest to advance their political careers.</strong> For Walz, sending people into the streets has the benefit of not having them at home watching and reading about the growing fraud scandal in his state.</p>

<p><strong>It is not a defense of democracy, but mobocracy in Minnesota.</strong></p>

<p>Forecasts of a massive oil glut are seriously exaggerated as demand keeps rising and global stocks are below the five-year average, according to Saudi Aramco’s chief executive officer, Amin Nasser. </p>

<p><em><strong>“Oil glut predictions are seriously exaggerated,”</strong></em> Nasser said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week as carried by <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/davos-aramco-ceo-says-oil-glut-predictions-are-seriously-exaggerated-2026-01-22/"">Reuters</a>.</p>

<p>Global oil stocks are low, while the amassed barrels in floating storage on tankers are mostly sanctioned supplies, the CEO of the world’s biggest oil firm and top crude exporter said. </p>

<p>Moreover, spare capacity has dwindled over the past year, also limiting potential efforts to boost output in case of major supply disruptions, according to Nasser. </p>

<p><em><strong>“It (spare capacity) is ‌at 2.5% and we need a minimum of 3%. If OPEC+ further unwinds cuts, spare capacity will ‌fall even further and we will need to watch this very carefully,”</strong></em> Aramco’s top executive said. </p>

<p>The market is <a href=""https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oils-Problem-Isnt-Iran-or-Russia-Its-Too-Much-Oil.html"">oversupplied</a>, analysts say, as reflected in only brief spikes in oil prices in recent weeks driven the geopolitical developments. </p>

<p><strong>Most investment banks and the EIA forecast that average oil prices will be below $60 per barrel in 2026 due to an emerging and persistent market oversupply, especially during the first half of the year.  </strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2026-01-22_u9p3zdif1h.jpg?itok=wCo1P_A_""><img alt="""" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" height=""209"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2026-01-22_u9p3zdif1h.jpg?itok=wCo1P_A_"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p><strong>But OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, insists that the market would be balanced as demand growth is robust and will remain such in 2027, too. </strong></p>

<p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) this week <a href=""https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/IEA-Raises-Forecast-of-Global-Oil-Demand-Growth-in-2026.html"">raised</a> its oil demand growth estimate and expects growth at 930,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2026, up by 70,000 bpd from last month’s assessment. </p>

<p><strong>The upgrade <a href=""https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-market-report-january-2026"">reflects</a> a recovery in feedstock demand in the petrochemicals industry,</strong> on top of expectations of normalized economic conditions after the unpredictable and chaotic tariff policy of the Trump Administration last year.</p>

<p>But the market continues to be oversupplied, the Paris-based agency noted. </p>

<p><em>“Indeed, benchmark crude oil prices remain $16/bbl lower than a year ago, reflecting the large global supply surplus that built up over the past 12 months, in line with our forecasts,”</em> the IEA said.</p>

            <div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p>In the following clip, <a href=""https://vongreyerz.gold/author/egon-von-greyerz"">Egon von Greyerz</a> explains why the precious metals market has entered a fundamentally new and unprecedented phase.</p>

<p>One which is driven not by speculation or momentum trading, but by <strong>deep structural imbalances between physical supply and an unprecedented physical demand.</strong></p>

<p>Persistent supply deficits in silver over several consecutive years, combined with rapidly rising industrial demand from sectors such as solar energy, electric vehicles, electronics and defense, have created a physical shortage in the last 5 years that paper markets can no longer mask.</p>

<p>At the same time, the volume of outstanding paper contracts in London and New York now vastly<strong> exceeds the amount of physical silver available for delivery. </strong></p>

<p>Von Greyerz warns that <strong>this imbalance marks a critical turning point,</strong> as silver transitions away from a manipulated paper-based system into a genuinely physical market, where <a href=""https://vongreyerz.gold/egon-von-greyerz-on-200-silver-the-monetary-endgame"">price is ultimately set by scarcity</a>, not leverage. </p>

<p><a href=""https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/gold-1-rt-gmh-251230_17671191468.jpg?itok=p6KKxflI""><img alt="""" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" height=""281"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/gold-1-rt-gmh-251230_17671191468.jpg?itok=p6KKxflI"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>Watch Egon explain why manipulation fails when physical precious metals run out...</p>

<p></p>

<p>Here are some key excerpts from the full transcript: (emphasis ours)</p>

<p>...<strong>this is a fundamental change.</strong> Some viewers might remember the late 1970s when silver quickly climbed from a few dollars up to $50. This was primarily speculation by the Hunt Brothers.</p>

<p>[01:44.7] And of course, the market could quickly sell enough paper silver to crash the price. And it didn't stay long at $50. <strong>This time, any selling that is attempted by bullion banks fails</strong> ,and we've seen many times being sold in the evening and, within a few hours, it's back up again.</p>

<p>[02:06.0] And this has happened last week again. Friday evening was sold off and then quickly went up to $90. I think we're quickly going to see $100 and more already in the Far East and in Australia, like the Perth Mint, selling now silver at over $100.</p>

<p>[02:25.0] So the price in London and in New York will have to follow. So what does that mean for the ordinary investors? Well, it clearly means that <strong>silver is just starting the move, and we are going to see, as I have stressed many times, we are going to see multiples of the current price</strong>.</p>

<p>[02:44.8] <strong>Will it correct? </strong>Of course, silver always corrects, but this is not a normal market because it's now turned into a physical market, which is it should always be rather than the manipulation that we have seen in paper markets. [03:00.0] So <strong>physical demand has gone from 10% of production to now 50% in the last year. </strong>That is a massive increase in demand, obviously stemming from solar panels, electric cars, electrical products, electronic products and also of course from defence contracts.</p>

<p>[03:18.4] Every missile uses quite a lot of silver, and all other electronic products and weapons use a big amount of silver now. <strong>So the demand is there on the physical side, and the demand is there on the investment side, and the production just isn't there. </strong></p>

<p>To satisfy this demand, we've had deficits for the last five years.  Those deficits are going to increase. This is why there will be constant demand for silver, and it is probable in the next year or two that there'll be failure in some markets. <strong>Whether that will be in the London market, and some bullion bank will go under.</strong> Whether that will be on Comex, we don't know.</p>

<p>[03:53.9] But the risk is very high.</p>

<p><strong>So it is obviously absolutely important for investors to hold nothing but physical silver, buy physical and hold it outside the banking system, not within the banking system. Don't buy ETFs, don't buy any futures, hold physical silver and keep it in a safe storage</strong>, in a safe vault like we do for clients, and keep it outside the banking system.</p>

<p>[04:19.7] Now, there are of course many other factors that influence the price of the metals. Gold is also going up, but as I have made clear for quite a while, silver will go twice as fast as gold in the coming years. Now the gold-silver ratio has gone from over 100 to about 50.</p>

<p>[04:36.4] <strong>Now the long-term ratio is probably going to be around the 15 level initially, but I wouldn't be surprised to see even lower than that,</strong> that being a natural level. But now I think the demand is of such magnitude and the supply so minuscule.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p><strong>Now I'm absolutely convinced we'll see $10,000 for gold.</strong> What does that mean for silver? If you take the gold-silver ratio at 15, which is an historical quite important level, then you divide 10,000 by 15, you get 666.</p>

<p>[05:38.3] So, a minimum we would see with <strong>silver, in my view, is $666. </strong></p>

<p>...</p>

<p><strong>But remember, you are not buying silver or gold for speculative purposes or to make money.</strong></p>

<p>[08:16.2] You are buying it to protect your wealth against the total destruction of wealth that we're going to see in the next few years. That is a destruction of paper wealth that is now, at levels which are unprecedented in history, because money printing has been unprecedented, and lending has been unprecedented.</p>

<p>[08:35.2] <strong>Countries will go bust, banks will go bust in America, in Europe. </strong>Whether it's due to property market, whether it's commercial markets, or people not being able to pay their loans, it doesn't matter. Many banks will go under. Governments and central banks are going to print unlimited amounts of money, and therefore, the value of your dollar, your euro or your pound is going to collapse.</p>

<p>[08:58.6] And that would be reflected in a <strong>much higher gold price</strong>...</p>

<p>According to the US Treasury, $69BN of 2 Year paper was just sold at a high yield of 3.580%, up from the 3.499% in December, and stopped through the When Issued 3.594% by 1.4bps, the biggest stop through since August.</p>

<p>The bid to cover jumped to 2.750, up from 2.543 and the highest since Nov 2024 (the six-auction average was 2.61). </p>

<p>The internals were even stronger: Indirects took down 64.4%, a big jump from 53.2% in December and the highest since March 2025. And with Directs awarded 28.3%, Dealers were left with just 7.3%, the second lowest on record (only Feb 2025 was lower).</p>

<p>Overall, this was a stellar auction and clearly there were no jitters head of Wednesday's FOMC decision, where prevailing consensus is that the Fed will be more hawkish.</p>

<p>Ahead of the auction, the UBS desk thought 2s looked to be locally cheap on outright terms and that the recent flattening had also introduced some value, albeit marginal, on the curve. The market is rallying on the follow. </p>

<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s first press conference of the year in late January touched upon a lot of topics, <strong><a href=""https://mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/2073858/#sel=282:1:Too,282:34:jyj"">importantly including</a> the Europeans’ plot to subvert Trump’s Ukrainian peace plan</strong>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2875%29_3.jpg?itok=oNwLa2fB""><img alt="""" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" height=""375"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2875%29_3.jpg?itok=oNwLa2fB"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>According to him,<strong> the UK “is speaking increasingly more often on behalf of the EU”</strong> and therefore plays a leading role in these efforts, “which boil down to one thing – an immediate <a href=""https://thealtworld.com/andrew_korybko/will-putin-agree-to-a-ceasefire"">ceasefire</a> complemented with legal security guarantees for Ukraine. The question is what these security guarantees concern.”</p>

<p>As Lavrov sees it, <strong>the purpose is “the preservation of the <a href=""https://thealtworld.com/andrew_korybko/lavrov-elaborated-on-russias-envisaged-denazification-of-ukraine"">current Nazi regime</a>”, which “will never legally recognise Crimea, Novorossiya and Donbass as Russia</strong>…And a ceasefire along the current line of contact, following which ‘the West will help,’ is unacceptable to us because they will build bases there.”</p>

<p>In that scenario, “[France and the UK] will <a href=""https://korybko.substack.com/p/what-are-the-us-calculations-for"">deploy a multinational force</a> in Ukraine, build a network of military hubs (bases) there… and pump more weapons into Ukraine to create threats for the Russian Federation.”</p>

<p><strong>In pursuit of these goals, they’re trying “to convince Trump (of their merits) and (then) let him force Putin to accept it, and that they will all go for it” once that happens.</strong></p>

<p><em>“Trump’s idea, which we discussed and supported in Anchorage, has been categorically rejected by that elite European group.” </em></p>

<p><strong>Lavrov didn’t mention it, but Trump hasn’t pushed back against the Europeans’ subversion of his Ukrainian peace plan, which was much more to Russia’s liking and at least presumably declared an intent to resolve root issues.</strong></p>

<p>This observation strongly suggests that he’s once again falling under others’ influence, in this case warmongering Europeans and their <a href=""https://korybko.substack.com/p/heres-how-lindsey-graham-manipulated"">neoconservative allies</a> in the US, perhaps after being misled into <a href=""https://voiceofeast.net/2022/04/08/vladimir-putin-monster-madman-or-mastermind/"">regarding Russia’s restraint</a> as a weakness that he can exploit to further his country’s zero-sum interests. <strong>These interests are to coerce the maximum number of concessions from Russia, ideally significant ones that weaken its overall strategic position, which Putin still rejects since he sees no reason to comply.</strong></p>

<p>It’s in connection with this goal that Lavrov’s warning about the US’ attempt to establish strategic superiority over Russia is relevant. He also talked about this during the same press conference. The pertinence is that neutralizing Russia’s nuclear second-strike capabilities through the four interconnected means that he touched upon and which were analyzed <a href=""https://korybko.substack.com/p/lavrov-warned-about-the-us-attempt"">here</a> might make such concessions more likely. Russia is capable of retaining these capabilities, however, so that goal won’t be achieved in this way.</p>

<p>Therefore, the US’ only recourse for furthering these zero-sum interests (if Trump remains under the influence of warmongering Europeans and their neoconservative allies in the US) is to perpetuate the conflict in parallel with intensifying secondary sanctions pressure, both of which are presently occurring.</p>

<p><strong>Trump could have punished the Europeans for subverting his Ukrainian peace plan agreed upon in Anchorage or at least told them to stop subverting it, but he’s thus far done neither to Russia’s chagrin.</strong></p>

<p>It can’t be ruled out that he might one day do so, yet for the time being, Russia is rightly skeptical of his intentions but also doesn’t want to risk offending him and consequently making the worst-case scenario of him doubling down on the conflict a self-fulfilling prophecy by openly expressing such sentiment. That explains why Lavrov only criticized the Europeans during his press conference and not Trump.</p>

<p><strong>Astute observers, however, can read between the lines and discern Russia’s displeasure with him too.</strong></p>

<p>New York natural gas futures surged sharply on Monday after <strong>roughly 12% of U.S. production was forced offline</strong> by a major winter storm and extreme cold blanketing the eastern half of the country.</p>

<p>The <strong>supply shock</strong> is now cascading into the power system, pressuring regional grids and prompting the Department of Energy to issue emergency orders allowing utilities in the PJM Interconnection and across the Northeast to operate fossil-fuel power plants at maximum capacity.</p>

<p>As heating demand spikes, oil, coal, and NatGas generation are providing a majority of the supply, <strong>preventing widespread rolling blackouts</strong> across the eastern half of the country. The focus has been on PJM's Mid-Atlantic region due to potential blackout risks.</p>

<p>""<strong>The winter storm is currently estimated to have knocked offline 12% of US natural gas production, just as demand for the heating and power-plant fuel jumped. The big freeze has strained electricity grids and crippled transportation, grounding thousands of flights</strong>,"" Bloomberg noted.</p>

<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), in a statement Saturday night said, “<strong>Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included.</strong>”</p>

<p>Democratic lawmakers have chosen to double down on their opposition to the funding measure, following the fatal shooting of an anti-ICE protester in Minneapolis on Saturday.</p>

<p>The funding bill has already been passed by the House but still lacks the 60 votes necessary to overcome the filibuster and to pass the measure in the U.S. Senate, where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority.</p>

<p>The approaching deadline has prompted numerous calls from GOP colleagues to Senate Majority Leader Thune to nuke the filibuster rule, particularly on appropriations bills, and to fund ICE immediately.</p>

<p>In the meantime, <strong>House Republicans are strategizing how they can turn the stalemate to their advantage</strong>, should Senate Democrats successfully reject the House appropriations.</p>

<p>Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) has indicated that, should those appropriations bills come back to the House, <strong>she and other Republican members of Congress will attach rules to the reworked bills that cannot be stripped from the legislation by Senate Democrats.</strong></p>

<p>This means that, in order to reopen the government, Democrats may be forced to vote on and pass the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act.</p>

<p>Luna explained that, by tying the SAVE Act to any rules package, “<strong>That would prevent the Senate from stripping the SAVE Act.</strong> It would force them.

            <div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p><strong>President Trump announced on Jan. 26 that he is sending border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota in the wake of the shooting of an anti-immigration enforcement protester by a federal agent.</strong></p>

<p>The president said in a morning Truth Social <a href=""https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115961647505369753"">post</a> that Homan would be going to Minnesota on Monday evening, noting that though Homan hasn’t been involved in operations there, he knows many officials in the state.</p>

<p><em><strong>“Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me,” </strong></em>Trump wrote.</p>

<p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt <a href=""https://x.com/PressSec/status/2015783033152864472"">confirmed</a> in a post on Monday that Homan would be investigating fraud in Minnesota, building on a multi-agency effort that was launched several weeks ago amid reports of fraudulent activity targeting federal and state entitlement programs.</p>

<p><a href=""https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%20-%202026-01-26T085234.875.jpg?itok=7lPVQHfz""><img alt="""" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" height=""333"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20-%202026-01-26T085234.875.jpg?itok=7lPVQHfz"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>The border czar, she added, would also be managing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in Minnesota to target illegal immigrants.</p>

<p><em><strong>“In addition, Tom will coordinate with those leading investigations into the massive, widespread fraud that has resulted in billions of taxpayer dollars being stolen from law-abiding citizens in Minnesota,”</strong></em> Leavitt wrote on X.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/trump-announces-hes-sending-tom-homan-to-minnesota-amid-protests-5976458?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=ZeroHedge"">As Jack Phillips reports for The Epoch Times,</a> the Trump administration has launched its most ambitious immigration operation to date in Minneapolis, sparking weeks of protests by residents and resulting in two shooting deaths.</p>

<p>A Border Patrol agent on Saturday <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/minneapolis-ceos-urge-de-escalation-after-fatal-shooting-by-border-patrol-agent-5976390"">fired</a> in self-defense after a man, identified later as Alex Pretti, approached with a handgun and violently resisted attempts to disarm him, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</p>

<p>It followed the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of U.S citizen Renee Good during a separate immigration operation.</p>

<p><strong>Democratic congressional lawmakers have warned that in the wake of the Pretti shooting, they could shut down the federal government at the end of January if Republicans do not pass a package without DHS funding.</strong></p>

<p><em>“Senate Democrats will not allow the current DHS funding bill to move forward,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) <a href=""https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/leader-schumer-statement-calling-on-senate-republicans-to-advance-five-appropriations-bills-ahead-of-deadline-and-rewrite-dhs-bill"">said</a> in a statement on Sunday before he criticized the Trump administration.</em></p>

<p><em>“People should be safe from abuse by their own government. Senate Republicans must work with Democrats to advance the other five funding bills while we work to rewrite the DHS bill.”</em></p>

<p><strong>In posts over the weekend and in his Truth Social comment Monday, Trump has shown no sign of backing down amid the protests. On Monday, he suggested that the operation was critical.</strong></p>

<p>Trump wrote that “a major investigation is going on with respect to the massive 20 Billion Dollar. ... Welfare Fraud that has taken place in Minnesota, and is at least partially responsible for the violent organized protests going on in the streets.”</p>

<p>Trump said Sunday that the operation in Minnesota was a key part of why he won in 2024 and signaled that Democratic politicians were to blame.</p>

<p><em>“Tragically, two American Citizens have lost their lives as a result of this Democrat ensued chaos,” the president said.</em></p>

<p>This morning, 'diplomacy' appears to be taking place as President Trump said in a Truth Social post (in a dramatic shift in tone) that <strong>Governor Tim Walz called him with the request to work together with respect to Minnesota</strong>.</p>

<p><em><strong>""It was a very good call, and we, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength,"" </strong></em>Trump said.</p>

<p><em>""I told Governor Walz that I would have Tom Homan call him, and that <strong>what we are looking for are any and all Criminals that they have in their possession</strong>. The Governor, very respectfully, understood that, and I will be speaking to him in the near future. </em></p>

<p><em><strong>He was happy that Tom Homan was going to Minnesota, and so am I! </strong>We have had such tremendous SUCCESS in Washington, D.C., Memphis, Tennessee, and New Orleans, Louisiana, and virtually every other place that we have “touched” and, even in Minnesota, Crime is way down, but both Governor Walz and I want to make it better!""</em></p>

<p>We will just have to see if the manufacture crisis ebbs after this... and just how Walz will respond to Trump's statement.</p>

            <div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p>Shares of Booz Allen Hamilton tumbled the most in months during late Monday morning trading after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent canceled dozens of contracts tied to the consulting firm.</p>

<p>Secretary Bessent said 31 contracts with Booz Allen were terminated, representing $4.8 million in annual spending and $21 million in total obligations.</p>

<p>""<strong>President Trump has entrusted his cabinet to root out waste, fraud, and abuse, and canceling these contracts is an essential step to increasing Americans' trust in government</strong>,"" he said, adding, ""Booz Allen failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data, including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service.""</p>

<p>Treasury pointed to an <a href=""https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0371"">incident</a> with Booz Allen in recent years:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Most notably, between 2018 and 2020, Charles Edward Littlejohn — an employee of Booz Allen Hamilton — stole and leaked the confidential tax returns and return information of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last spring, Booz Allen said it was undergoing a major restructuring and planned to cut roughly 2,500 jobs, about 7% of its workforce, as President Trump's DOGE efforts reduced government spending by discontinuing federal contracts.</p>

<p>Later in the year, CEO Horacio Rozanski told investors the company was ""making the difficult decision to reduce layers and numbers in our senior ranks"" due to federal contract reductions and a broader slowdown in government funding.</p>

<p>Shares of Booz Allen are down 7.5% in the cash session this morning, marking the worst single-day decline since October 24, when the stock fell about 9%. Shares have been cut roughly in half since President Trump's November 2024 election victory, as Elon Musk's DOGE initiative began aggressively targeting waste, fraud, and abuse across the federal bureaucracy in early 2025.</p>

<p>Today, January 26th, it was confirmed true.</p>

<h3>Business Overview and Segments</h3>

<p>The company operates as a <strong>single reportable operating segment</strong> focused on the vertically integrated production of rare earth element magnets. Its business model encompasses the entire value chain through the following core components:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Upstream (Mining):</strong> Development of the <strong>Round Top</strong> deposit in <strong>Sierra Blanca, Texas</strong>, which is the richest known domestic source of <strong>heavy rare earth elements</strong>, <strong>gallium</strong>, <strong>beryllium</strong>, and <strong>yttrium</strong>.</p>

	<ul><li>
		<p><strong>Gallium:</strong> <strong>Round Top</strong> is one of the largest known deposits of <strong>gallium</strong>, a mineral where <strong>China</strong> currently accounts for approximately <strong>98%</strong> of primary production. It is essential for <strong>semiconductors</strong>, <strong>compound semiconductors</strong>, and <strong>defense technologies</strong>, and was recently subject to export bans by <strong>China</strong>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Beryllium:</strong> This element is used in specialized applications including <strong>military radar</strong>, <strong>nuclear power</strong>, <strong>X-rays</strong>, and <strong>MRIs</strong>. Its presence at <strong>Round Top</strong> was identified as early as the <strong>1970s</strong> associated with fluorite deposits.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Yttrium:</strong> Classified as a <strong>heavy rare earth</strong>, <strong>yttrium</strong> is critical for <strong>radiation therapy</strong> for certain cancers and is a foundational material for <strong>chemical vapor deposition</strong> in semiconductor manufacturing.</p>
		</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Midstream (Processing & Metal-Making):</strong> Ownership of <strong>Less Common Metals (LCM)</strong>, a leading producer of rare earth metals and alloys based in the <strong>UK</strong>, and development of a processing lab in <strong>Wheat Ridge, Colorado</strong>.</p>

	<ul><li>
		<p><strong>LCM</strong> is the only proven scaled producer of rare earth <strong>metals</strong>, <strong>alloys</strong>, and <strong>strip casting</strong> outside of <strong>China</strong>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Feedstock Security: </strong>The acquisition ensures a reliable supply of <strong>NdFeB strip cast alloy</strong>, which is a mandatory input for the <strong>Stillwater, Oklahoma</strong> magnet facility.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Specialized Materials:</strong> <strong>LCM</strong> provides leadership in <strong>Samarium</strong> and <strong>Samarium Cobalt</strong> metals, which are critical for defense and medical sectors and identified as high-risk for supply vulnerabilities.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Circular Manufacturing:</strong> <strong>LCM</strong> brings the ability to process <strong>recycled rare earth oxides</strong> from end-of-life magnets and production <strong>swarf</strong>, creating a more sustainable supply chain.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Hafnium Extraction:</strong> During piloting of its separation methods, the company successfully isolated <strong>hafnium</strong>, a material used in <strong>advanced semiconductors</strong> and <strong>nuclear reactors</strong>.</p>
		</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Downstream (Magnet Manufacturing):</strong> A <strong>310,000 sq. ft.</strong> manufacturing facility in <strong>Stillwater, Oklahoma</strong>, designed for large-scale production of <strong>sintered Neodymium Iron Boron (NdFeB)</strong> magnets.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Circular Economy:</strong> Integration of <strong>recycling</strong> capabilities to recover materials from end-of-life magnets and production <strong>swarf</strong>, creating a sustainable closed-loop system.</p>
	</li>
</ul><h3>Remaining Steps for Full Vertical Integration</h3>

<p>While the LCM acquisition closes a major gap, several components are still required to fully realize the end-to-end domestic strategy.</p>

<h3>1) Mining and Processing Development</h3>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Technical Milestones:</strong> The company must still complete the <strong>Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS)</strong> and a <strong>Definitve Feasibility Study (DFS)</strong> for the <strong>Round Top</strong> project. Commercial production at the <strong>Texas</strong> mine is not expected to begin until <strong>late 2028</strong>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Separation Scaling:</strong> While separation has been proven at the <strong>Wheat Ridge</strong> lab, <strong>USAR</strong> needs to scale these technologies to handle <strong>8,000 metric tons per annum</strong> of concentrates.</p>
	</li>
</ul><h3>2) Manufacturing and Infrastructure</h3>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Domestic Metal-Making:</strong> While <strong>LCM</strong> provides metal-making in the <strong>UK</strong>, <strong>USAR</strong> still needs to “return this capability home” by establishing rare earth metal-making facilities within the <strong>United States</strong>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Capacity Expansion:</strong> Full commissioning of the <strong>Stillwater</strong> magnet facility is scheduled for <strong>Q1 2026</strong>. The company plans to scale magnet production from an initial <strong>1,200 tpa</strong> to a target of <strong>5,000 tpa</strong>, which requires additional capital and equipment installation.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>European Expansion:</strong> Plans to build a <strong>3,750 mtpa</strong> metal and alloy plant in <strong>France</strong> are underway but require further development and construction.</p>
	</li>
</ul><h3>How the company is addressing the premier bottlenecks identified:</h3>

<p>USAR is scaling its operations through a combination of proprietary technological development at its <strong>Wheat Ridge</strong> facility and a massive <strong>$1.6 billion</strong> government-backed investment to establish domestic metal-making capabilities.</p>

<h3>Scaling Separation Processes to 8,000 Metric TPA</h3>

<p>To transition from bench-scale testing to a commercial capacity of <strong>8,000 metric tons per annum (tpa)</strong> of concentrates, the company is implementing the following steps and technologies:</p>

<h4>Continuous Demonstration and Digital Twin Technology</h4>

<ul><li>
	<p>USAR is collaborating with the <strong>U.S. Department of Energy</strong> to leverage <strong>digital twin technology</strong> and process modeling to advance separation at the <strong>Wheat Ridge</strong> lab.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The company plans to operate a <strong>Hydromet demonstration facility</strong> in Colorado for <strong>2,000 to 4,000 continuous hours</strong> starting in early <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>This demonstration plant will run <strong>five parallel solvent-extraction (SX) circuits</strong> to generate the operational data required for commercial plant design.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The scaling strategy involves moving from <strong>batch testing</strong> to <strong>continuous testing</strong> by significantly increasing the volume of rock processed to create enough bulk leach solution.</p>
	</li>
</ul><h4>Process Optimization and Engineering Partners</h4>

<ul><li>
	<p>The company has selected <strong>Fluor Corp.</strong> and <strong>WSP Global Inc.</strong> as <strong>EPCM partners</strong> to advance the <strong>Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS)</strong> and manage large-scale infrastructure delivery.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Research at the <strong>Colorado Facility</strong> is specifically focused on refining separation processes that <strong>minimize the use of organic solvents</strong>, aiming for a lower waste profile than traditional methods.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Engineering work is currently focused on “fine-tuning” the separation of bulk <strong>gallium</strong>, as well as <strong>heavy and light rare earths</strong>, into distinct concentrate streams.</p>
	</li>
</ul><h3>Establishing Domestic Metal-Making</h3>

<p>USAR is addressing the lack of domestic rare earth metal-making by integrating the expertise of its <strong>Less Common Metals (LCM)</strong> acquisition directly into its U.S. operations.</p>

<h4>Integration at Stillwater, Oklahoma</h4>

<ul><li>
	<p>USAR intends to return metal making to the United States by integrating <strong>LCM’s</strong> capabilities into its <strong>Stillwater, Oklahoma</strong> facility.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The <strong>Stillwater</strong> site is being developed to house the <strong>largest metal-and-alloy-making</strong> and strip-casting capability outside of China.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The facility will produce essential feedstocks for magnets, including <strong>NdPr</strong>, <strong>dysprosium</strong>, <strong>terbium</strong>, and <strong>samarium cobalt</strong> metals.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The company aims to reshore approximately <strong>10,000 tonnes per year</strong> of heavy rare earth metal and alloy production capacity to the U.S.</p>
	</li>
</ul><h4>Strategic Support and Workforce Development</h4>

<ul><li>
	<p>A <strong>$1.6 billion Letter of Intent</strong> with the U.S. government and <strong>$1.5 billion in private investment</strong> are earmarked to accelerate the build-out of these domestic capabilities.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>To address the shortage of skilled labor in the U.S., USAR is launching an <strong>apprenticeship program</strong> to train domestic metal makers and transfer expertise from the <strong>UK-based LCM team</strong>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The domestic metal-making operations will utilize a “circular” approach, incorporating both <strong>mined feedstock</strong> from <strong>Round Top</strong> and <strong>recycled materials</strong> (such as magnet swarf).</p>
	</li>
</ul><h3>Important Notes on Management</h3>

<h2 id=""core-allegation"">Core allegation</h2>

<p><strong>In a detailed thread “documenting [his] findings,” </strong>ZachXBT claimed that an online figure known as “Lick,” identified as John Daghita, <strong>“siphoned tens of millions of dollars in crypto from wallets linked to the US government.”​</strong></p>

<p>He further alleged that Daghita is the son of Dean Daghita, president and chief executive of Command Services & Support (CMDSS), a Virginia‑based firm contracted by the U.S. Marshals Service to safeguard seized digital assets classified as “Class 2–4” tokens that require bespoke custody solutions.​</p>

<h2 id=""trace-from-bitfinexlinked-wallets"">Trace from Bitfinex‑linked wallets</h2>

<p>According to on‑chain traces cited by ZachXBT, the allegedly compromised funds were linked to assets seized in the 2016 <a href=""https://crypto.news/bitfinex-confirm-64-million-hack-btc-usd-slumps/"">Bitfinex hack</a>, with one wallet receiving “$24.9 million from a US government‑controlled wallet in March 2024.”</p>

<p><strong>The probe builds on an earlier <a href=""https://crypto.news/us-government-transfers-922m-in-bitcoin-from-seized-bitfinex-hack-funds/"">investigation</a>, published January 23, that tied the “Lick” persona to “more than $90 million in suspected illicit crypto activity”</strong> routed through a network of addresses associated with government‑linked wallets.​</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.cryptopolitan.com/john-lick-daghita-us-government-contract/"">As Hannah Collymore reports for Cryptopolitan.com,</a> that up until two days ago, John Lick had avoided detection.</p>

<h2>John 'Lick' Daghita’s flamboyant lifestyle outed him</h2>

<p>He had over $20 million in crypto wallets.</p>

<p><strong>However, things started to unravel when he got into a heated argument with another threat actor known as Dritan Kapplani Jr. in a group chat to see who had more funds in crypto wallets.</strong></p>

<p>By the time the <a href=""https://www.cryptopolitan.com/zachxbt-threat-actor-john-lick-tied-to-90m/"">showoff session</a> wrapped up, John had flaunted $23 million in total, moving the funds between wallets ZachXBT claims he clearly controls. </p>

<p>After that, Zach began tracing backwards to verify the source of funds and found that one of the wallets, the 0xc7a2 wallet, had <strong>previously received $24.9 million from a U.S. government wallet back in March 2024. </strong></p>

<p><strong>That transaction was linked to funds the government seized in the Bitfinex hack,</strong> and Zach had already flagged that same address in a post from October 2024. Another wallet was linked, the 0xd8bc wallet, which goes back to $63 million obtained from sketchy wallets during Q4 2025. </p>

<h2>John just enjoys showing off</h2>

<p><strong>According to reports, it was only a matter of time before this happened, given how much John loves to show off</strong>. The Telegram account linked to him reportedly has a long history of bragging about his riches and brokeshaming people.</p>

<p>His username is tied to TG ID 8269661864. After he was outed by Zach, he allegedly wiped out his NFT usernames and quickly changed his screen name, but the damage was already done. </p>

<p>Zach later revealed that there are rumors circulating in cybercrime Telegram circles indicating John could be John Daghitia, who had previously been arrested in September 2025. He did concede that more research was needed to fully confirm it. </p>

<p><strong>Since he made the link between John and his father, Zach claims the CMDSS company X account, website, & LinkedIn were all deactivated</strong>, and John Daghita (Lick) began trolling again on Telegram shortly after.</p>

<p><a href=""https://crypto.news/who-is-john-daghita-inside-the-us-governments-40m-crypto-theft-case/"">As Andrew Folkler reports for Crypto.news concludes</a>, this is not the first issue faced by CMDSS.</p>

<h2>Prior CMDSS scrutiny and systemic risk</h2>

<p>CMDSS’s appointment already faced challenges when rival Wave Digital Assets filed a protest with the Government Accountability Office, arguing the firm lacked key registrations and warning of potential conflicts involving a former Marshals Service official, though the GAO later denied the protest.</p>

<p>Separately, a 2025 CoinDesk report found<strong> the Marshals Service struggled to reconcile its digital asset holdings</strong>, underscoring broader concerns around federal crypto custody as illicit addresses received a record “$154 billion in 2025,” up sharply year‑on‑year.</p>

<p>For now, there have been <strong>no public arrests or DOJ confirmations</strong>, but the onchain evidence has been making rounds across the Internet. Law enforcement could eventually intervene.</p>

<p><strong>While Elon Musk is rightly credited for transforming X into a battleground for unfiltered truth, he dropped two bombshells this week that could significantly reshape the platform.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Elon_2.jpg?itok=a3z9OBt1""><img alt="""" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" height=""281"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Elon_2.jpg?itok=a3z9OBt1"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>In a move that promises cleaner feeds but sparks fears of shadowy content policing, <strong>Musk revealed plans for topic-specific “For You” tabs free from “political rage bait” and an outright mute tool for all political posts</strong>. Critics are already sounding alarms over potential censorship creep.</p>

<p>Musk’s move comes as a direct response to some user gripes about X turning into a rage-fueled echo chamber. With immigration debates, election fallout, and globalist agendas dominating timelines, Musk’s tweaks aim to let users opt out of the frenzy. But in an era where Big Tech has a history of silencing conservative voices, the big question looms: who defines “rage bait,” and does this undermine the free speech haven Musk vowed to build?</p>

<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"">
<p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"" xml:lang=""en"">The <a href=""https://twitter.com/xai?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@xAI</a> team is working on providing For You tabs that are specific to topics.<br /><br />
For example, a “For You AI” that is focused only on artificial intelligence with no political rage bait.<br /><br />
This would be like automatically generated follow lists with content ranked by quality.</p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=""https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/2014881720948973907?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">January 24, 2026</a></blockquote>
<p>Musk first teased the changes in a <a href=""https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2014881720948973907"">post</a> on Saturday, explaining that his xAI team is crafting specialized “For You” tabs. “The @xAI team is working on providing For You tabs that are specific to topics,” he wrote. As an example, he pointed to a “For You AI” tab “focused only on artificial intelligence with no political rage bait.” He likened it to “automatically generated follow lists with content ranked by quality.”</p>

<p>Then, on Sunday, Musk doubled down in response to a frustrated user complaining about the app’s political overload. The user lamented,<em><strong> “bro how do i mute all political posts on this app holy hell it has turned into reddit.”</strong></em></p>

<p>Musk’s reply was straightforward: “I agree. Working on it.” This suggests a broader tool to blanket-mute political content across the platform, not just in curated tabs.</p>

<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"">
<p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"" xml:lang=""en"">I agree. Working on it.</p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=""https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/2015404390614495311?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">January 25, 2026</a></blockquote>
<p><strong>Replies to Musk’s announcements highlight the divide. </strong></p>

<p>Supporters cheered the move, with one user saying it would help “normal posts that never get seen” rise above the din.</p>

<p>Others, however, blasted it as a step toward echo chambers. “Yes let’s put people into echo chambers and make sure they can’t see what’s going on so it can continue….silence is complicity,” fired back one critic in the thread.</p>

<p>Skeptics point to Musk’s own feed, often laced with pointed commentary on issues like unchecked immigration and government overreach.</p>

<p><em><strong>“You literally post political rage bait all day and night,” quipped another responder.</strong></em> If the boss sets the tone, how fair will the filtering be?</p>

<p>These updates may aim to “enhance content quality” by shifting from a one-size-fits-all algorithm to personalized, high-signal feeds. The move aligns with Musk’s push against legacy media’s stranglehold, but it echoes past Big Tech controversies where “quality” often meant suppressing dissenting views on topics like election integrity or vaccine mandates.</p>

<p><strong>At its core, X under Musk has been a win for free speech and truth</strong>—exposing media hypocrisy, amplifying anti-globalist narratives, and giving a platform to those shut out by Silicon Valley elites. Yet this new direction raises red flags. If algorithms decide what’s “political” or “rage bait,” could conservative takes on border crises or woke indoctrination get flagged and blocked?</p>

<p>Musk has repeatedly championed free speech, vowing to make X a town square for all ideas. But tools like these could inadvertently—or intentionally—tilt the scales. Who programs the AI to spot “rage bait”?</p>

<p><strong>True freedom means no gatekeepers, even well-intentioned ones.</strong> Muting and blocking posts of any nature risks creating just another filtered bubble, stifling the voices that need to be heard most.</p>

            <div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p>With the year still not yet four weeks old, it’s already been a constant firehose of news volatility, even as market volatility has remained relatively contained, DB's Jim Reid writes this morning. Consider: we’ve moved from Venezuela to Japan, via Iran and Greenland, with a range of other themes running in the background. These now include President Trump on Saturday threatening 100% tariffs on Canada if China strikes a trade deal with them, and the odds of another US government shutdown after January 30th (Friday) jumping on Polymarket from 8% on Friday to 78% this morning. This followed Senate Democratic leader Schumer warning that they will block the spending package unless Republicans defund Homeland Security after a Border Patrol shooting at a protest in Minnesota on Saturday linked to the immigration crackdown.</p>

<p>If that weren’t enough, Rick Rieder’s odds of becoming the next Fed Chair surged from around 33% as Europe closed on Friday to over 60% at one point over the weekend, before settling at 47% this morning. The perception in markets is that he would be more market friendly than the previous front runner, Kevin Warsh, who is now trading at 29% on Polymarket. He was at 65% last Monday. Finally in the UK, Andy Burnham was yesterday blocked by the ruling Labour Party from contesting an imminent by-election. Burnham is seen as a potential challenger to PM Starmer with lots of party support. Gilts may see some relative relief this morning as Burnham had said last September that the UK needs to ""get beyond being in hock to the bond markets"". </p>

<p>With all this going on it's perhaps no wonder that Gold (+8.52%) was within two-tenths of a percent of its best week since 2008, marginally behind one week in 2020. It's up another +1.7% this morning and has flown past $5000 for the first time. However the Dollar has just had its worst week for 8 months, falling against all its peers, and has continued to weaken this morning.</p>

<p>So there are plenty of balls in the air right now, but the one perhaps most urgently needing careful handling is Japan. On Friday afternoon in Europe, <strong>ZeroHedge broke news that the New York Fed had conducted a “rate check” on USD/JPY on behalf of the US Treasury. </strong>This morning, the Japanese yen is around +1%, trading at ~154 against the dollar, marking its strongest position since November. Various official have refused to confirm or deny overnight any intervention so far. 2yr JGBs are around +3bps higher with 10yr and 30yr yields -1bps and flat respectively while the Nikkei is -1.90% due to the strong Yen since Friday.</p>

<p>With all that in mind, let's take a look at the coming week. </p>

<p>The main event this week will be <strong>the Fed’s decision on Wednesday </strong>with the main focus not on the likely unchanged Fed Funds rate but on what Powell says about a variety of things in the presser (more below). <strong>The Bank of Canada </strong>meet the same day with <strong>Sweden’s Riksbank </strong>meeting on Thursday, with both also expected to be on hold. Finally, the <strong>ECB </strong>will publish its monthly consumer expectations survey on Friday.</p>

<p>In terms of data, the US sees durable goods (today), consumer confidence (tomorrow) and PPI (Friday).</p>

<p>In Europe preliminary January CPI for countries including German and Spain are released, alongside Q4 GDP for the main economies all on Friday. The German Ifo is out today.</p>

<p>Over in Asia, a likely busy week of news flow for Japan is bookended with a big data dump on Friday featuring the <strong>Tokyo CPI, consumer confidence, retail sales and industrial production. </strong>The Lower House <strong>election campaign begins tomorrow ahead of the 8 February vote. </strong>Other notable indicators due in the region include December industrial profits in China tomorrow and Q4 CPI in Australia on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Rounding out with corporate earnings, an important week is ahead featuring <strong>results from four Magnificent 7 stocks – Microsoft, Meta and Tesla on Wednesday and Apple on Thursday. </strong>The four make up 16% of the S&amp;P 500 by market cap, with the overall list of firms reporting this week totaling 32% of aggregate capitalization. Other tech highlights include ASML, Samsung, IBM and SAP. The focus will also be on defense firms RTX, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin. On Friday, big oil firms Exxon and Chevron will also report. In Europe, highlights also include LVMH, Roche and Sanofi.</p>

<p>Previewing Wednesday’s FOMC meeting, DB economists <strong>expect the Federal Reserve to leave policy unchanged while striking a slightly firmer tone on the underlying economic backdrop. </strong>Although the usual focus would be on the policy outlook, circumstances this time mean that Chair Powell’s press conference is likely to dwell heavily on non-economic matters. Questions will inevitably surface around the recent DoJ subpoena, the situation involving Governor Cook, and the broader issue of future Fed leadership. Powell will probably lean on the themes of his recorded statement from 11 January, <strong>emphasizing the importance of institutional independence and resisting political pressure — a message he is unlikely to dilute given the current environment.</strong></p>

<p>On the policy statement itself, expect the Fed to upgrade its description of growth from the previous “moderate pace” to something closer to a “solid pace,” consistent with Vice Chair Jefferson’s comments on 16 January. They also expect the Committee to acknowledge a somewhat steadier labor market, reflecting the more recent data flow available since the November meeting. Inflation is trickier: with core PCE still running at 2.8% year on year into November, progress has been limited, and the Committee may simply reiterate that inflation remains “somewhat elevated,” echoing Jefferson’s framing of recent developments.</p>

<p>Where the statement may shift most meaningfully is the second paragraph. Over the past several meetings, <strong>the Fed has justified its easing bias by pointing to rising labor market risks. </strong>Given the more balanced labor picture and the lack of discernible improvement on inflation, DB economists believe the Committee may drop its explicit reference to labor market deterioration and revert to the more neutral line that it remains attentive to risks on both sides of the mandate — while stopping short of last year’s language that risks were “roughly balanced.”</p>

<p>Taken together, <strong>Wednesday’s decision and press conference should reinforce the idea that policy is now within the Fed’s estimated range of neutral and that the Committee is well placed to respond in either direction if incoming data justify a move. </strong>Nearly all voters are likely to endorse that message, though Governor Miran will likely dissent in favour of additional easing. </p>

<p><u><strong>Monday, January 26 </strong></u></p>

<ul><li><strong>08:30 AM Durable goods orders, November preliminary (GS +5.0%, consensus +4.0%, last -2.2%); Durable goods orders ex-transportation, November preliminary (GS +0.3%, consensus +0.3%, last +0.1%); Core capital goods orders, November preliminary (GS +0.3%, consensus +0.3%, last +0.5%); Core capital goods shipments, November preliminary (GS +0.4%, consensus +0.2%, last +0.8%): </strong>We estimate that durable goods orders rebounded 5% in the preliminary November report (month-over-month, seasonally adjusted), reflecting an increase in commercial aircraft orders.

            <div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p>BlackRock TCP Capital Corp., a<strong> publicly traded private-credit fund structured as a business development company,</strong> filed an 8-K with the SEC late Friday afternoon, disclosing <strong>a 19% markdown in net asset value</strong> as troubled loans weighed on performance. The move marks one of the first major private credit signal woes of the new year.</p>

<p>The credit fund told investors in the 8-K filing that NAV fell from $8.71 as of Sept. 30 to $7.05 to $7.09, or about a 19% markdown.</p>

<p><em><strong>""This decline is primarily driven by issuer-specific developments during the quarter,"" </strong></em>the fund said.</p>

<p>For a simpler translation: <em>borrower-level stress intensified, loans deteriorated, and expected recovery values collapsed.</em></p>

<p>According to Bloomberg, <strong>the credit fund ""has struggled in part because of its exposure to e-commerce aggregators</strong> — companies that buy and manage Amazon.com Inc. sellers — as well as troubled home improvement company Renovo Home Partners, which has filed for bankruptcy with plans to liquidate.""</p>

<p>A TCPC fact sheet published Sept. 30 shows the fund holds 83% first-lien exposure across software, internet software and services, financial services, and other professional services.</p>

<p><a href=""https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2026-01-24_13-19-00.png?itok=RuLAkAsn""><img alt="""" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" height=""352"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2026-01-24_13-19-00.png?itok=RuLAkAsn"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Analyst coverage of TCPC is overwhelmingly negative.</strong></p>

<p>There are zero ""buy"" recommendations among analysts tracked by Bloomberg, with three ""hold"" ratings and one ""sell."" The average 12-month price target stands at $6.50.</p>

<p><strong>Shares of TCPC dropped 8.2% in after-hours trading on Friday following the filing.</strong></p>

<p>Over a longer timeframe, the stock has slid back to COVID-era lows and remains locked in a multi-year bear market.</p>

<p>We've been closely tracking private credit markets, observing bumps along the way, to determine whether the cycle is beginning to show early signs of systemic risk or simply reflecting a normal credit downturn. While credit conditions have remained benign for an extended period, several emerging warning signs have begun to surface, which we have highlighted:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><em><a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/blue-horseshoe-doesnt-blue-owl-private-credit-provider-abandons-merger-plan"">""There's No Emergency Here"": Blue Owl CEO Says As Private Credit Provider Abandons Merger Plan</a></em></p>

	<li>
	<p><a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/regional-banks-crash-more-credit-cockroaches-emerge""><em>Regional Banks Crash As More Credit ""Cockroaches"" Emerge</em></a></p>
	</li>
</ul><p>As a reminder, last fall, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon warned, <em><strong>""When you see one cockroach, there are probably more.""</strong></em></p>

<p>However, not everyone sees a crisis coming, despite the surge in supply.</p>

<p>We recently quoted Jeff Eason, Head of IG Credit at Citadel Securities, who says the market is in the early stages of a <strong>robust </strong>Capital Markets cycle, <strong>driven by Credit Expansion</strong>, fueling two themes:</p>

<ol><li>
	<p><em>M&amp;A activity and broad corporate re-leveraging and</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Growth in AI CapEx with debt usage becoming necessary/attractive to fund the mega cycle.</em></p>
	</li>
</ol><p>Jeffrey Gundlach has recently called out private lenders for making ""garbage loans"" and warned the next financial crisis will be in private credit.</p>

<p>Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi told CNBC that <strong>private credit is ""lightly regulated, less transparent, opaque, and it's growing really fast,</strong> which doesn't necessarily mean there's a problem in the financial system, but it is a necessary condition for one.""</p>

<p>The rumblings in private credit raise deeper questions about the soundness of the broader financial system and whether the Trump economy, with incoming tailwinds from data-center, power grid buildouts, and re-manufacturing trends, can withstand potential stress in credit markets.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump has revealed that U.S. forces used a secret weapon to disable Venezuelan military equipment in the Jan. 3 operation that resulted in the arrest of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.</p>

<p><em><strong>“The Discombobulator. I’m not allowed to talk about it,” </strong></em>Trump said in an <a href=""https://nypost.com/2026/01/24/us-news/trump-reveals-to-the-post-secret-discombobulator-weapon-was-crucial-to-venezuelan-raid-on-maduro/"">interview</a> with the New York Post published on Jan. 24.</p>

<p>Trump said the weapon disabled Venezuelan equipment during the operation, enabling U.S. forces to capture Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, from their residence in Venezuela’s capital, Caracas.</p>

<p><em>“They never got their rockets off. They had Russian and Chinese rockets, and they never got one off. <strong>We came in, they pressed buttons, and nothing worked.</strong> They were all set for us,” he said.</em></p>

<p>The president did not explain how the weapon worked or how it was deployed.</p>

<p>This comment from the president fits with the alleged eye-witness account, <a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/military/white-house-amplified-shocking-claims-us-super-soldiers-deployed-maduro-raid"">as we previously posted</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p style=""line-height: 21px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);""><em><strong>Security Guard</strong>: At one point, they launched something—I don't know how to describe it... <strong>it was like a<span> </span></strong><strong><strong>very intense sound wave.</strong> Suddenly I felt like my head was exploding from the inside.

<p>In a Fox News interview aired on Jan. 3, Trump <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/what-we-know-about-the-us-operation-that-captured-venezuelas-maduro-5965618?ea_src=author_manual&amp;ea_med=related_stories"">said</a> the special operations forces who conducted the raid “rehearsed and practiced like nobody’s ever seen,” and had built a model version of the location they operated in. He said Maduro “was in a house that was more like a fortress than a house.”</p>

<p><em>“It had steel doors. It had what they call the safety space, where it’s, you know, solid steel all around,” Trump told the news outlet.</em></p>

<p><em>“He didn’t get that space closed. He was trying to get into it, but he got bum rushed so fast that he didn’t get into that. We were prepared.”</em></p>

<p><strong>At least 32 Cuban officers deployed to assist Maduro in Venezuela were killed in the U.S. attack</strong>, <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/cuba-says-32-cuban-officers-killed-in-us-military-operation-in-venezuela-5966108"">according</a> to the Cuban government, which has denounced the operation.</p>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href=""https://www.state.gov/releases/2026/01/secretary-of-state-marco-rubio-with-kristen-welker-of-nbcs-meet-the-press/"">said</a> on Jan. 4 that Maduro’s internal security apparatus was “entirely controlled by Cubans.”</p>

<p>“The ones who have sort of colonized, at least inside the regime, are Cubans. It was Cubans who guarded Maduro. He was not guarded by Venezuelan bodyguards,” Rubio said.</p>

<p>Following Maduro’s ouster, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez was appointed interim leader by Venezuela’s Supreme Court and was <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/maduro-to-be-arraigned-in-federal-court-on-narco-terrorism-charges-5966110?ea_src=author_manual&amp;ea_med=related_stories"">sworn</a> in on Jan. 5.</p>

<p><strong>Trump <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/trump-acting-venezuelan-leader-will-face-consequences-if-she-doesnt-do-whats-right-5965932"">warned</a> Rodríguez after the U.S. operation that her fate could be worse than Maduro’s—who is facing drug and arms-related charges in the United States—if she fails to “do what’s right.”</strong></p>

Other exports, including Canadian canola meal, lobsters, crabs, and peas will also not be subject to Chinese anti-discrimination tariffs until at least the end of 2026. </p>

<p><strong>A week later</strong>, Carney told the global elite at Davos resort that the ""rules-based order"" established by the United States and its allies following WW2 was fraying amid the current rivalry between China and America, so<strong> the ""middle powers must act together because if we're not on the table, we're on the menu."" </strong></p>

<p>Carney said that for their survival, <strong>nations should no longer “go along to get along” with Trump.</strong></p>

<p>This flew up Donald Trump's ass sideways, who issued a <a href=""https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115950424403894234"">response</a> on Truth Social Saturday:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“<strong>If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a ‘Drop Off Port’ for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken. </strong>China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social on the morning of Jan. 24.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>“If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump’s reference to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney as “Governor” marks a return to the relations the U.S. president had with Carney’s predecessor, former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, using the title to reflect his view that Canada should be part of the United States.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the sidelines of the WEF, Trump said that ""Canada gets a lot of freebies from us. By the way, they should be grateful also, but they’re not,” adding, ""<strong>Canada lives because of the United States</strong>. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.""</p>

<p>Treasury Secretary <strong>Scott Bessent</strong> echoed Trump's comments on Sunday, telling <em>ABC News</em> that America could not ""let Canada become an opening that the Chinese pour their cheap goods into the U.S.""</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Carney 'Clarifies'</h2>

<p><strong>So on Sunday</strong>, Carney told reporters that <strong>Canada respects its obligations under the Canada-US-Mexico trade agreement</strong> (CUSMA / USMCA), and will not pursue a free trade agreement without notifying the other two parties. </p>

<p>""<strong>What we have done with China is to rectify some issues that have developed in the last couple of years</strong>,” adding that the deal was “entirely consistent with CUSMA,"" he said. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Trump notably raised tariffs on Canadian goods from 25% to 35% in August 2025. </p>

            <div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p><a href=""https://modernity.news/2026/01/24/minnesota-business-owner-claims-ice-will-start-putting-people-in-ovens/""><em>Authored by Steve Watson via Modernity.news,</em></a></p>

<p><strong>An unhinged leftist business owner from Minnesota told CNN’s Jake Tapper that there is no question ICE is running “concentration camps” and that federal officers could start “putting people in ovens” soon.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/clown.jpg?itok=naoLHzUe""><img alt="""" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" height=""281"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/clown.jpg?itok=naoLHzUe"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>Tapper was platforming the deranged lunatic as a smattering of leftist-leaning shops in the city have shuttered their doors in “solidarity” against basic immigration enforcement, painting law-abiding agents as invaders while conveniently ignoring the chaos of open borders.</p>

<p>Jamie Schwesnedl, co-owner of Moon Palace Books in Minneapolis was there to explain why his business had closed for the day in protest against ICE operations, yet Tapper was provided a peak under that veneer and into the world of TDS radicalism.</p>

<p></p>

<p><em><strong>“We can’t do business as usual right now, anyway, because our city has been invaded by masked gunmen kidnapping family members and friends and neighbors of ours to send them to concentration camps,” </strong></em>Schwesnedl proclaimed.</p>

<p>He added, “Additionally, there’s a lot of businesses in our area that have staff or customers or owners who are afraid to come to work, afraid to come in and shop. People are closing down today, and we felt like it wouldn’t be kind or fair for us to stay open, so we’re closing in solidarity to help send a message.”</p>

<p>This over-the-top rhetoric frames ICE agents – who are simply doing their job to enforce laws passed by Congress – as some kind of Nazi militia. It’s a classic leftist tactic: demonize border control to keep the floodgates open, even as communities suffer from the fallout of Biden-era lax policies that invited millions across unchecked.</p>

<p>Things escalated when Schwesnedl doubled down on his terminology, prompting Tapper to interject.</p>

<p><strong>The CNN host, known for his establishment leanings, surprisingly pushed back, stating “Just one note, I’m not here to defend ICE, but I’m not a big fan of people using the term ‘concentration camp’ to describe detention camps. That has a very specific meaning.”</strong></p>

<p>Schwesnedl wasn’t deterred. He fired back with historical references twisted to fit his narrative.</p>

<p>“I understand that, but they take people to Fort Snelling here, which literally was built as a concentration camp, and Alligator Alcatraz, which I think we can all agree is a concentration camp,” he replied.</p>

<p>Then came the kicker.<em><strong> </strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>“I’m not saying they’re Dachau. I’m not saying they’re putting people in ovens — yet — but these are concentration camps. I don’t need to argue with you about that.”</strong></em></p>

<p>That “— yet —” slips in like a Freudian admission, hinting at the wild conspiracy theories bubbling under the surface of anti-ICE activism. It’s not just exaggeration; it’s a deliberate smear against efforts to secure the nation, echoing the same hysteria that labeled Trump-era policies as “fascist” while ignoring the human trafficking and fentanyl crises fueled by porous borders.</p>

<p>For context, ICE detention facilities are civil holding centers for noncitizens caught illegally in the U.S., awaiting due process or deportation. They’re a far cry from the historical concentration camps Schwesnedl invokes, like those under Nazi Germany, which were instruments of genocide. Fort Snelling, a 19th-century military site in Minnesota, has a complex history including internment of Native Americans, but equating it to modern ICE ops is a stretch designed to inflame rather than inform.</p>

<p>The remarks underscore how these protests rely on emotional hyperbole over facts. In addition, the store closures involved only a “handful” of businesses, hardly a mass uprising, hardly worth even mentioning, yet CNN amplifies it as if it’s a national crisis.</p>

<p>Tapper’s stunned reaction highlights a rare crack in the media facade: even CNN hosts balk at rhetoric that veers into Holocaust trivialization. But Schwesnedl’s refusal to back down shows the depths of progressive entitlement, where enforcing borders is akin to invasion, and detaining lawbreakers is oppression.</p>

<p><strong>It’s the perfect snapshot of leftist media propagandists and TDS activists spiraling as America First policies finally bite back against unchecked migration.</strong> Instead of addressing real community threats like crime waves tied to illegal entries, they’re equating detentions to historical atrocities – all to stir fear and undermine border security.</p>

            <div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p>Nvidia increased its investment in CoreWeave to accelerate the buildout of AI factories, adding more than 5 gigawatts of AI computing capacity by 2030. This builds on an existing agreement under which Nvidia has committed to buy more than $6 billion in services from the firm through 2032. </p>

<p>""Demand for AI continues to grow exponentially and the need for compute has never been greater. To help meet this demand, NVIDIA and CoreWeave are deepening their infrastructure, software, and platform alignment,"" CoreWeave wrote in a press release.</p>

<p>The new deal involves Nvidia purchasing $2 billion of CoreWeave Class A common stock at $87.20 per share.</p>

<p><a href=""https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Snag_3f61551e.png?itok=SXmfdFy_""><img alt="""" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" height=""273"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Snag_3f61551e.png?itok=SXmfdFy_"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>Here's what the expanded Nvidia-CoreWeave collaboration means:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><em>Build AI factories developed and operated by CoreWeave using NVIDIA's leading accelerated computing platform technology to meet customer demand.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Leverage NVIDIA's financial strength to accelerate CoreWeave's procurement of land, power and shell to build AI factories.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Test and validate CoreWeave's AI-native software and reference architecture, including SUNK and CoreWeave Mission Control, to unlock deeper interoperability and work towards including those offerings within NVIDIA's reference architectures for NVIDIA's cloud partners and enterprise customers.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Deploy multiple generations of NVIDIA infrastructure across CoreWeave's platform through early adoption of NVIDIA computing architectures, including the Rubin platform, Vera CPUs and Bluefield storage systems</em></p>
	</li>
</ul><p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang commented, <strong>""AI is entering its next frontier and driving the largest infrastructure buildout in human history.""</strong></p>

<p>Jensen added, ""CoreWeave's deep AI factory expertise, platform software, and unmatched execution velocity are recognized across the industry. Together, we're racing to meet extraordinary demand for NVIDIA AI factories - the foundation of the AI industrial revolution.""</p>

<p>The collaboration builds on CoreWeave's purpose-built cloud, which enables customers to run AI workloads more efficiently and at scale.</p>

<p><a href=""https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/coreweavemainfinal.jpg?itok=hmUqRQAR""><img alt="""" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" height=""266"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/coreweavemainfinal.jpg?itok=hmUqRQAR"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator said in a Bloomberg interview that Nvidia funding accounts for about 2% of what his company plans to spend on new infrastructure. ""This year, we're going to deliver an enormous amount of infrastructure, and that's just going to accelerate over the next three years,"" he said.</p>

<p><em>CoreWeave shares in premarket trading were up nearly 10%, while Nvidia shares were marginally lower.</em></p>

<p><strong>All of this echoes the circular AI ""<a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/stunning-math-behind-ai-vendor-financing-circle-jerk"">circle jerk</a>"" deals that we pointed out last fall and has only helped propel the AI bubble.</strong></p>

<p>Futures dropped but then rebounded, tracking moves in the Nikkei which slumped as the yen surged on signs that Tokyo and Washington coordinated on rate checks. This fueled volatility in foreign-exchange markets, as traders viewed the steps as preparation for direct intervention. Joint US-Japan action would give authorities greater power to deter speculators after the yen fell to an 18-month low earlier this month.</p>

<p>“The bigger signal is policy coordination,” said Daniel Baeza, senior vice president at Frontclear. “If markets interpret coordination as a willingness to tolerate easier global dollar conditions, especially alongside a dovish Fed reaction function, that could reinforce short-term dollar downside.”</p>

<p>Traders are also monitoring the possibility of a partial government shutdown. Senate Democrats have insisted that funding for the Department of Homeland Security be split off until Congress can agree on new guardrails for immigration enforcement, after agents killed two US citizens this year in Minnesota. Senate Republican leaders plan to reject the demands. </p>

<p>“A potential shutdown would clearly represent some downside risks for the market mood as we just recover form the last one,” said BNP’s Kemper.</p>

<p>Besides a govt shutdown, earnings will be in the spotlight as the busiest week of the season gets underway, with four of the Magnificent Seven tech giants due to report. The group has driven market gains for much of the past three years, but that leadership faltered in late 2025 as Wall Street grew skeptical of whether massive AI spending will deliver returns. Results from Meta, Apple, Tesla and Microsoft will be dissected to see how their massive spending on AI is translating into profits. Earnings from RTX, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman will likely reflect increased demand for weapons amid geopolitical tensions.</p>

<p>“The main focus from investors will likely be comments around AI-capex,” said Stephan Kemper, chief investment strategist at BNP Paribas Wealth Management. “Any sign of a slowdown could be seen as hyperscalers losing trust in the possibility to monetize those investments in a timely manner.”</p>

<p>Some of Wall Street’s top strategists are beginning to see early evidence that US profit growth is spreading beyond tech megacaps. An analysis by JPMorgan shows that <strong>forward guidance has topped expectations at roughly half of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have provided an outlook for 2026. </strong>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. also expects earnings to support an expansion.  “Since most of the companies that have reported are outside the tech sector, this trend suggests a broadening of growth across other industries this year,” JPMorgan strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas wrote in a note.</p>

<p>In Europe, the Stoxx 600 is down 0.1%, opened on either side of the unchanged mark, before moving a little lower to now display a mixed/mostly negative picture. European sectors have opened mixed to slightly negative. Leading sectors are Basic Resources (+1.0%), Banks (+0.8%) and Energy (+0.6%). Basic Resources continues to be underpinned by strength in metal prices as gold and silver continue to gain strength as havens, whilst the energy sector has gained on the back of firmer crude prices. At the bottom of sectors reside, Travel & Leisure (-1.0%), Food Beverage & Tobacco (-0.9%) and Technology (-0.6%).</p>

<p>Asian stocks advanced amid choppy trading as gains in technology and material shares offset a slump in Japanese equities. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose as much as 1.1% early on Monday before halving its advance. MediaTek and Tencent provided the biggest boost. The Asian benchmark — which rose in each of the past five weeks — was also buoyed on Monday by gains in mining shares. The cohort climbed alongside metal prices as investors rotated into hard assets such as gold. Investors are awaiting earnings from some of the world’s top technology firms this week for further cues after the sector’s relentless rally. Stocks in Japan underperformed the region as exporters tumbled amid a yen rally sparked by increased speculation that authorities may intervene to support the currency’s slide. Gains in Asian stocks Monday also came amid broad weakness in the dollar as investors debated how potential US involvement in foreign-exchange intervention in Japan might worsen sentiment toward the world’s reserve currency.</p>

<p>In rates, treasuries hold small gains led by long-end tenors, with 20- and 30-year yields down 1bp-2bp from Friday’s closing levels as traders added to bets for 2026 interest-rate cuts after BlackRock Inc. executive Rick Rieder’s candidacy to helm the Federal Reserve gained momentum. With an announcement on the next Fed chair possible as soon as this week, rate expectations will be in focus as current Chair Jerome Powell delivers the latest decision on Wednesday. US front-end yields are little changed, leaving 2s10s and 5s30s spreads about 1bp flatter; <strong>10-year near 4.21% is about 1bp lower vs 3bp decline for German counterpart, 5bp for French 10-year. </strong>European bonds outperform led by France following continued progress on budget plans. Dollar extends slide amid speculation the US could coordinate intervention with Japanese authorities to support the yen. This week’s Treasury coupon auctions begin a day early with 2-year notes; Treasury coupon auctions this week include 2-, 5- and 7-year notes on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday respectively, with FOMC rate decision Wednesday. WI 2-year yield near 3.59% is about 9bp cheaper than last month’s, which tailed by 0.3bp.</p>

<p>In FX, the yen surges on speculation of intervention, with the dollar sinking against most major currencies on deteriorating sentiment toward the greenback. However, <strong>Bank of Japan data offered no clear signal on whether the country intervened on Friday. </strong>Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index falls to lowest since September, while USDJPY dropped as low as 154 before rebounding.  </p>

<p>In commodities, gold rallies to a new record well above $5,100/ounce, and silver surges to around $109/ounce as investors seek out havens. Treasuries are higher and European bonds are rising. Oil prices wavering, with Brent hovering around $66/barrel.</p>

<p><strong>APAC stocks were mostly subdued amid Japanese intervention concerns and US President Trump's latest tariff threat against Canada, </strong>in which he threatened to impose 100% tariffs if it makes a deal with China. Risk sentiment was also not helped by the Democrats threatening a partial government shutdown in revolt against the fatal shooting of an ICE protester in Minneapolis, while market conditions were somewhat quieter owing to the holiday closures in Australia and India. Nikkei 225 underperformed with the index pressured by a firmer currency amid US-Japan joint intervention concerns after Japanese PM Takaichi said the government is ready to take action against speculative moves, and with reports last Friday that the New York Fed conducted rate checks on USD/JPY. Hang Seng and Shanghai Comp were indecisive with demand contained amid reports that China is likely to target growth of 4.5% to 5% in 2026, while stocks also failed to benefit from news late last week that China told the biggest tech firms they can prep NVIDIA H200 orders.</p>

<ul><li>DXY gapped lower at the open from Friday's 97.456 close, with the index off its worst and best levels at the time of writing, towards the middle of a 96.949-97.333 band. The index remains suppressed by the aforementioned JPY strength, alongside risks of a US government shutdown also increasing after Democrats said they will not support a funding package without changes to homeland security provisions.</li>
	<li>JPY is the standout gainer, bolstered by double intervention risk after Japanese PM Takaichi warned that the government is ready to take action against speculative moves amid a weakening currency and surge in bond yields, while it was reported on Friday that the New York Fed had conducted rate checks on USD/JPY. Analysts at ING succinctly highlight two reasons for Washington's involvement: ""a) the weak yen was adding to last week's JGB sell-off and indirectly driving US Treasury yields higher. If there is any financial instrument more important than the stock market to the White House right now, it is US Treasuries. And b) the strong USD/JPY was potentially unwinding the work of US tariffs on Japan and giving Japanese manufacturers a competitive advantage."" USD/JPY slumped from Friday's 155.74 close to a Monday trough at 153.40, slightly under the 100 DMA (153.54).</li>
	<li>EUR benefits from the USD weakness but trades off best levels after hitting resistance at 1.1898 (vs 1.1837 low) shortly after the resumption of trade. Little action was seen on the sub-par German Ifo report, and with the EZ docket also light ahead.</li>
	<li>CHF mildly gains due to its haven status amid the looming US government shutdown, alongside President Trump's 100% tariff threat on Canada if it makes a trade deal with China. On that note, USD/CAD trades on a softer footing amidst the aforementioned USD weakness, with the pair also dipping under the psychological 1.3700 mark to a 1.3675 low at the time of writing.</li>
	<li>Antipodeans trade on a firmer footing with AUD underpinned as spot gold briefly topped USD 5,100/oz earlier in the session. AUD reached a high of 0.6934 from a 0.6896 close on Friday.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Fixed Income</strong></p>

<ul><li>Fixed income benchmarks are in the green. USTs firmer by a handful of ticks, at the top-end of a 111-25 to 111-29+ band. The US session is relatively quiet, aside from 2yr supply ahead. Strength for fixed is perhaps a function of the slight equity pressure, which in turn can be explained at least in part by ongoing/renewed trade tensions relating to the US, Canada and China, after Trump's rhetoric. One other point of support might be the US conducting a rate check in the JPY on Friday, as this could be interpreted as a precursor to joint intervention; given the moves in long-end Japanese yields seen last week, and the global influence that had, any such action could target JGBs in addition to the Yen.</li>
	<li>Bunds are firmer, with gains of just over 20 ticks at best. Specifics for the bloc are a little light, with no move seen to German Ifo, which came in softer-than-expected for the climate figure, while the other components were mixed vs prev. For the EZ, the week is mainly waiting to see how the trade situation develops, with the EU meeting today to discuss unfreezing EU-US talks.</li>
	<li>Gilts outperform, gains of c. 30 ticks at a 91.56 high. Upside that is, primarily, being driven by the news that Greater Manchester Mayor Burnham will not be able to run for the vacant Labour MP seat. This blocks Burnham from launching a leadership challenge against PM Starmer, as some have speculated he might, despite Burnham himself suggesting Starmer is the best person to be PM currently. While welcomed by Gilts, the block has prompted significant backlash against PM Starmer from within the Labour Party, and as such, this narrative may return.</li>

</ul><p><strong>DB's Jim Reid concludes the overnight wrap</strong></p>

<p>With the year still not yet four weeks old, it’s already been a tour de force of news volatility, even as market volatility has remained relatively contained. We’ve moved from Venezuela to Japan, via Iran and Greenland, with a range of other themes running in the background. These now include President Trump on Saturday threatening 100% tariffs on Canada if China strikes a trade deal with them, and the odds of another US government shutdown after January 30th (Friday) jumping on Polymarket from 8% on Friday to 78% this morning. This followed Senate Democratic leader Schumer warning that they will block the spending package unless Republicans defund Homeland Security after a Border Patrol shooting at a protest in Minnesota on Saturday linked to the immigration crackdown.</p>

<p>If that weren’t enough to be getting on with, Rick Rieder’s odds of becoming the next Fed Chair surged from around 33% as Europe closed on Friday to over 60% at one point over the weekend, before settling at 47% this morning. The perception in markets is that he would be more market friendly than the previous front runner, Kevin Warsh, who is now trading at 29% on Polymarket. He was at 65% last Monday.</p>

<p>Finally in the UK, Andy Burnham was yesterday blocked by the ruling Labour Party from contesting an imminent by-election. Burnham is seen as a potential challenger to PM Starmer with lots of party support. Gilts may see some relative relief this morning as Burnham had said last September that the UK needs to ""get beyond being in hock to the bond markets"".  However this story is unlikely to completely go away. With all this going on it's perhaps no wonder that Gold (+8.52%) was within two-tenths of a percent of its best week since 2008, marginally behind one week in 2020. It's up another +1.7% this morning and has flown past $5000 for the first time. However the Dollar has just had its worst week for 8 months, falling against all its peers, and has continued to weaken this morning.</p>

<p>So there are plenty of balls in the air right now, but the one perhaps most urgently needing careful handling is Japan. On Friday afternoon in Europe, news broke that the New York Fed had conducted a “rate check” on USD/JPY on behalf of the US Treasury. </p>

<p>This morning, the Japanese yen is around +1.1%, trading at 154.05 against the dollar, marking its strongest position since November. Various official have refused to confirm or deny overnight any intervention so far. 2yr JGBs are around +3bps higher with 10yr and 30yr yields -1bps and flat respectively while the Nikkei is -1.90% due to the strong Yen since Friday.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Asia, the KOSPI (-0.90%) is lower with some looking at the weak KRW as a potential for intervention risk. The Korean Wong is up +1.7% this morning. Chinese equities are up a little with S&amp;P 500 (-0.28%) and NASDAQ 100 (-0.41%) futures both lower.</p>

<p>The main event this week will be the Fed’s decision on Wednesday with the main focus not on the likely unchanged Fed Funds rate but on what Powell says about a variety of things in the presser (more below). The Bank of Canada meet the same day with Sweden’s Riksbank meeting on Thursday, with both also expected to be on hold. Finally, the ECB will publish its monthly consumer expectations survey on Friday. In terms of data, the US sees durable goods (today), consumer confidence (tomorrow) and PPI (Friday). In Europe preliminary January CPI for countries including German and Spain are released, alongside Q4 GDP for the main economies all on Friday. The German Ifo is out today.</p>

<p>Over in Asia, a likely busy week of news flow for Japan is bookended with a big data dump on Friday featuring the Tokyo CPI, consumer confidence, retail sales and industrial production. The Lower House election campaign begins tomorrow ahead of the 8 February vote. Other notable indicators due in the region include December industrial profits in China tomorrow and Q4 CPI in Australia on Wednesday (our economists expect the quarterly trimmed mean print at 0.9% QoQ / 3.3% YoY).</p>

<p>Rounding out with corporate earnings, an important week is ahead featuring results from four Magnificent 7 stocks – Microsoft, Meta and Tesla on Wednesday and Apple on Thursday. The four make up 16% of the S&amp;P 500 by market cap, with the overall list of firms reporting next week totalling 32% of aggregate capitalisation. Other tech highlights include ASML, Samsung, IBM and SAP. The focus will also be on defence firms RTX, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin. On Friday, big oil firms Exxon and Chevron will also report. In Europe, highlights also include LVMH, Roche and Sanofi.</p>

<p>Previewing Wednesday’s FOMC meeting, our economists expect the Federal Reserve to leave policy unchanged while striking a slightly firmer tone on the underlying economic backdrop. Although the usual focus would be on the policy outlook, circumstances this time mean that Chair Powell’s press conference is likely to dwell heavily on non-economic matters. Questions will inevitably surface around the recent DoJ subpoena, the situation involving Governor Cook, and the broader issue of future Fed leadership. Powell will probably lean on the themes of his recorded statement from 11 January, emphasising the importance of institutional independence and resisting political pressure — a message he is unlikely to dilute given the current environment.</p>

<p>On the policy statement itself, our economists expect the Fed to upgrade its description of growth from the previous “moderate pace” to something closer to a “solid pace,” consistent with Vice Chair Jefferson’s comments on 16 January. They also expect the Committee to acknowledge a somewhat steadier labour market, reflecting the more recent data flow available since the November meeting. Inflation is trickier: with core PCE still running at 2.8% year on year into November, progress has been limited, and the Committee may simply reiterate that inflation remains “somewhat elevated,” echoing Jefferson’s framing of recent developments.</p>

<p>Where the statement may shift most meaningfully is the second paragraph. Over the past several meetings, the Fed has justified its easing bias by pointing to rising labour market risks. Given the more balanced labour picture and the lack of discernible improvement on inflation, our economists believe the Committee may drop its explicit reference to labour market deterioration and revert to the more neutral line that it remains attentive to risks on both sides of the mandate — while stopping short of last year’s language that risks were “roughly balanced.”<br />
Taken together, Wednesday’s decision and press conference should reinforce the idea that policy is now within the Fed’s estimated range of neutral and that the Committee is well placed to respond in either direction if incoming data justify a move. Nearly all voters are likely to endorse that message, though Governor Miran will likely dissent in favour of additional easing. </p>

<p>Recapping last week, markets endured another round of whipsaw action amid lingering questions over Greenland. As a reminder, over the previous weekend Trump announced 10% tariffs on several European countries by February 1 and until the US obtained control of Greenland. That sent the STOXX 600 (-1.19%) to its worst performance in two months on Monday, while the S&amp;P 500 (-2.06%) posted its worst day in three months when US markets returned on Tuesday. Sentiment improved on Wednesday after Trump said the US would not use force to acquire Greenland and dropped the tariff threat after agreeing to “a framework of a future deal” with NATO’s Mark Rutte. Equities recovered somewhat, but the STOXX 600 (-0.98%, -0.09% on Friday) and the S&amp;P 500 (-0.35%, +0.03% on Friday) still ended the week lower. This was the first time since June that the S&amp;P had seen two consecutive weekly declines.</p>

<p>It wasn’t all negative: a tech rebound pushed the Mag 7 +1.10% higher (+1.04% Friday). And although the VIX closed above the 20 level for the first time since November on Tuesday, it finished the week little changed at 16.09 (+0.23 bps). Meanwhile, geopolitical concerns helped gold rise to within sight of the $5,000 level, with its best week since the early months of Covid in 2020 (+8.52% to $4,987/oz). Silver also surged +14.50% to $103.19/oz (+7.22% Friday), extending its YTD gain to +44%.</p>

<p>Bond markets saw similarly turbulent moves. The most dramatic shifts came in JGBs, where the 30yr yield spiked +26.6bps on Tuesday to 3.84%, its biggest daily increase since 1999. The moves later moderated, with 30yr JGB yields ending the week +14.6bps higher and 10yr yields +6.7bps higher. In Europe, 10yr bunds (+7.1bps) and gilts (+11.2bps) also sold off as geopolitical volatility heightened concerns about increased European defence spending and the resulting fiscal pressure.</p>

<p>US Treasuries initially slumped on geopolitical noise and firm data, but ended the week little changed. The 2yr yield rose +0.7bps to 3.95% (-1.2bps Friday), while the 10yr yield edged up +0.2bps to 4.23% (-2.0bps Friday). The stronger US data included initial jobless claims falling to 200k (vs 209k expected), which pushed the 4 week moving average to a 2 year low of 201.5k, and Friday’s stronger than expected University of Michigan final consumer sentiment reading (56.4 vs 54.0 expected). Despite that, yields rallied late on Friday, supported by rising expectations that Rick Rieder would be chosen as the next Fed Chair.</p>

<p>The dollar index fell -1.80%, its worst week in eight months (-0.77% on Friday). By contrast, the Japanese yen — which had been drifting toward its weakest levels since 2024 — sharply rebounded on Friday (+1.74% to 155.70 against the dollar) amid renewed speculation about FX intervention. That followed a relatively uneventful BoJ decision earlier on Friday, which left rates unchanged at 0.75%, with one dissent (8–1) in favour of another 25bp hike.</p>

<p>Let's see what this week brings as an eventful January draws to a close!!</p>

<p><strong>The Pentagon released its new National Defense Strategy late on Jan. 23</strong>, placing the homeland and a surrounding sphere of influence as the top priority for the U.S. military.</p>
<a href=""https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%2815%29_4.jpg?itok=Ww-S9R4e""><figure class=""caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images""><img alt="""" height=""333"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%2815%29_4.jpg?itok=Ww-S9R4e"" width=""500"" /><figcaption><em>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth speaks during the POW/MIA National Recognition Day Ceremony at the Pentagon, Friday, Sept. 19, 2025, in Washington.

<p>Nearly two months after the White House <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/trumps-new-national-security-strategy-key-takeaways-5954307"">released</a> President Donald Trump’s National Security Strategy, <strong>the new 34-page Pentagon <a href=""https://media.defense.gov/2026/Jan/23/2003864773/-1/-1/0/2026-NATIONAL-DEFENSE-STRATEGY.PDF"">document</a> provides specifics regarding how the U.S. military will support the president’s strategy</strong>. In particular, it describes four specific lines of effort for military planners going forward.</p>

<p>“No longer will the Department be distracted by interventionism, endless wars, regime change, and nation building. Instead, we will put our people’s practical, concrete interests first,” Secretary of War Pete Hegseth wrote in a memorandum accompanying the new strategy document.</p>

<p>Here are the four key lines of effort outlined in the new National Defense Strategy and how they fit into Trump’s security and foreign policy framework.</p>

<h2>1. Sphere of Influence</h2>

<p><strong>The Pentagon describes defending the U.S. homeland as the “foremost priority”</strong> Trump has given the military.</p>

<p>“The Department will therefore prioritize doing just that, including by defending America’s interests throughout the Western Hemisphere,” the document states.</p>

<p>As part of this first priority, the Pentagon noted U.S. military efforts to secure the United States’ borders and to combat drug trafficking throughout the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p><strong>U.S. forces began amassing near Latin America in August 2025 and carried out strikes on drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific for months.</strong> They also seized sanctioned oil tankers sailing to and from Venezuela.</p>

<p>Those moves preceded an operation into Venezuela, during which U.S. forces apprehended the country’s wanted leader, Nicolás Maduro, to face federal charges for an alleged drug trafficking conspiracy.</p>

<p>President James Monroe articulated a U.S. pledge to oppose European colonial efforts in the Western Hemisphere in an address to Congress in December 1823 that<strong> later came to be known as the Monroe Doctrine.</strong></p>

<p>In the weeks leading up to Maduro’s capture, the Trump administration began increasingly referring to a “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine.</p>

<p>In a press conference following Maduro’s capture, Trump explicitly referenced Monroe’s 1823 doctrine and said, “<strong>Under our new national security strategy, American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again.</strong>”</p>

<p>Since ordering Maduro’s capture, Trump has also ramped up talk of a U.S. acquisition of Greenland, which is currently a semiautonomous territory of Denmark. Trump has said the island territory is key to U.S. national security.</p>
<a href=""https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%2816%29_3.jpg?itok=3J6BS44L""><figure class=""caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images""><img alt="""" height=""333"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%2816%29_3.jpg?itok=3J6BS44L"" width=""500"" /><figcaption><em>Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores (rear), are escorted by federal agents after landing at a Manhattan helipad, as they make their way into an armored car en route to a federal courthouse in New York City on Jan. 5, 2026. XNY/Star Max/GC Images</em></figcaption></figure></a>

<p>The new strategy document states that the Pentagon will “provide the President with credible options to guarantee U.S. military and commercial access to key terrain from the Arctic to South America, especially Greenland, the Gulf of America, and the Panama Canal.”</p>

<p><strong>The document further declared the Pentagon’s intent to support Trump’s Golden Dome missile defense initiative.</strong></p>

<p>U.S. nuclear force modernization and cybersecurity are also listed under the first line of effort, as is countering Islamic terrorism.</p>

<p>“The Department will maintain a resource-sustainable approach to countering Islamic terrorists, focused on organizations that possess the capability and intent to strike the U.S. Homeland,” the document states.</p>

<h2>2. China and Indo-Pacific Deterrence</h2>

<p>As the U.S. military adjusts its global strategy, the Pentagon is charged with finding ways to deter China while seeking to avoid confrontation with the nuclear-armed power.</p>

<p><strong>The Pentagon said it will follow Trump’s lead in engaging with Chinese counterparts and supporting deconfliction efforts.</strong></p>

<p>The strategy document does not mention any intent to be in direct conflict with China, but it states that the responsibility of the military is “to ensure that President Trump is always able to negotiate from a position of strength in order to sustain peace in the Indo-Pacific.”</p>

<p>Under this priority, the U.S. military “will build, posture, and sustain a strong denial defense” along what’s known as the first island chain.</p>

<p>The first island chain includes mainland Japan, the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Borneo.</p>

<p>“<strong>We will also work closely with our allies and partners in the region to incentivize and enable them to do more for our collective defense</strong>, especially in ways that are relevant to an effective denial defense,” the new National Defense Strategy states.</p>

<p>One effort to bolster regional allies involves a trilateral security partnership among Australia, the UK, and the United States, known as AUKUS. The partnership began in 2021 during President Joe Biden’s administration.</p>

<p><strong>In June 2025, the Pentagon placed the AUKUS partnership under <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/pentagon-reviewing-submarine-defense-partnership-with-uk-and-australia-5871460"">review</a>. In October, Trump <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/trump-says-aukus-may-not-be-needed-us-military-power-enough-to-deter-ccp-5932548"">suggested</a> the partnership might be unnecessary.</strong></p>

<p>The Trump administration has since expressed <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/aukus-in-full-swing-australia-us-alliance-fortified-in-ausmin-meeting-5955480"">support</a> for the group, and in December 2025, Hegseth said, “We are strengthening AUKUS so that it works for America, for Australia, and for the UK.”</p>

<h2>3. Burden-Sharing</h2>

<p>As with the alliance-building in the Indo-Pacific, the new National Defense Strategy emphasizes a need for allies and partners across the globe.</p>

<p>The strategy document describes a “simultaneity problem” wherein multiple adversaries of the United States might act in concert to stretch U.S. military resources.</p>

<p>“<strong>Such a scenario would be less of a concern if our allies and partners had spent recent decades investing adequately in their defenses.</strong> But they did not,” the document states.</p>

<p>“Instead, with rare exceptions, they were too often content to allow the United States to defend them, while they cut defense spending and invested instead in things like public welfare and other domestic programs.”</p>

<p>The document states that the United States will push for partners in Europe, the Middle East, and the Korean Peninsula to take primary responsibility for their defenses, “with critical but limited support from U.S. forces.”</p>

<p>According to the strategy document, Mexico and Canada will have a role to play in the Western Hemisphere, helping prevent drug trafficking and illegal immigration into the United States.</p>

Jacob Garcia/Reuters</em></figcaption></figure></a>

<p>“Canada also has a vital role to play in helping to defend North America against other threats, including by strengthening defenses against air, missile, and undersea threats,” the document adds.</p>

<p><strong>In Europe, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members are expected to “take primary responsibility for Europe’s conventional defense.”</strong></p>

<p>Trump has already championed a pledge for the NATO members to each <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/nato-members-endorse-5-percent-defense-spending-target-5877999"">commit</a> 5 percent of their annual gross domestic product to defense and national security spending, up from a goal of 2 percent in 2014.</p>

<h2>4. Arms Manufacturing</h2>

<p>The fourth area of focus detailed in the Pentagon’s new strategy document is to bolster the United States’ arms industry.</p>

<p>The document states that this reindustrialization effort “is vital to ensuring that U.S. forces have the weapons, equipment, and transportation and distribution capability needed” to implement the strategy.</p>

<p>“It is also critical to ensuring that the United States can help arm allies and partners as they take on a greater share of the burden of our collective defense, including by leading efforts to deter or defend against other, lesser threats,” it reads.</p>

<p>This month, <strong>Hegseth <a href=""https://www.war.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/4370464/secretary-of-wars-arsenal-of-freedom-tour-to-rally-nation/"">began</a> touring U.S. arms manufacturing facilities in what he’s dubbed the “Arsenal of Freedom” tour.</strong></p>

Ryan Morgan/The Epoch Times</em></figcaption></figure></a>

<p>Hegseth and Trump have taken other recent steps to reform the military’s arms acquisition <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/hegseth-outlines-5-pillars-for-overhauling-us-arms-procurement-process-5943644"">process</a>.</p>

<p>“<strong>We’re leaving the old failed process behind, and we’ll instead embrace a new agile and results-oriented approach</strong>,” Hegseth said in a speech to industry leaders at the National War College in Washington on Nov. 7, 2025.</p>

<p>In a series of social media posts on Jan. 7, Trump <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/trump-says-raytheon-could-lose-business-over-stock-buybacks-5967573"">criticized</a> Raytheon and other arms manufacturers for the compensation packages they are giving to corporate executives and for offering stock buybacks and paying out dividends to shareholders.</p>

<p>Along with working with established traditional vendors, the National Defense Strategy states that the Pentagon will also seek to bolster organic manufacturing capabilities and grow nontraditional vendors to grow the U.S. arms industry.</p>

	2026-01-26	ZeroHedge (Markets)	EU Launches New Probe Into Musk's AI Chatbot Grok	https://www.zerohedge.com/technology/eu-launches-new-probe-musks-ai-chatbot-grok	"<span class=""field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden"">EU Launches New Probe Into Musk's AI Chatbot Grok </span>

            <div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p>The European Commission has opened a new formal investigation into Elon Musk's X under the Digital Services Act (DSA) and expanded a separate probe launched in December 2023.</p>

<p>""The new investigation will assess whether the company properly assessed and mitigated risks associated with the deployment of Grok's functionalities into X in the EU,"" the European Commission wrote in a press release, adding, ""This includes risks related to the dissemination of illegal content in the EU, such as manipulated sexually explicit images, including content that may amount to child sexual abuse material.""</p>

<p>The Commission is examining whether X:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><em>Diligently assess and mitigate systemic risks, including of the dissemination of illegal content, negative effects in relation to gender-based violence, and serious negative consequences to physical and mental well-being stemming from deployments of Grok's functionalities into its platform.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Conduct and transmit to the Commission an ad hoc risk assessment report for Grok's functionalities in the X service with a critical impact on X's risk profile prior to their deployment.</em></p>
	</li>
</ul><p>""Non-consensual sexual deepfakes of women and children are a violent, unacceptable form of degradation,"" EU tech commissioner Henna Virkkunen said, who was quoted by Bloomberg. This case falls under the DSA, which places strict guardrails on harmful and illegal material on the web. And it's up to Brussels to define what is illegal material...</p>

<p><a href=""https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2026-01-26_06-53-18.png?itok=dt3KmO11""><img alt="""" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" height=""271"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2026-01-26_06-53-18.png?itok=dt3KmO11"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>X, a subsidiary of xAI, pointed Bloomberg to a previous statement that it actively removes illegal content where necessary: ""We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content.""</p>

<p>The EU's Grok investigation comes shortly after a separate 120 million euro fine imposed on X under the DSA.</p>

<p>In that earlier case, EU regulators found that X's paid blue check system misled users, the company obstructed researchers' access to platform data, and it failed to properly establish an advertising transparency repository.</p>

<p>Vice President JD Vance criticized Brussels in an X post last month, saying, ""The EU should be supporting free speech, not attacking American companies over garbage.""</p>

<p>Our assessment is that the EU's move against Grok has little to do with safety. If it did, regulators would be scrutinizing every major social media platform and chatbot operating on the continent. Instead, Brussels appears unwilling to tolerate free speech or anything associated with Elon Musk.</p>

<p>Forcing xAI out of the EU would only confirm that the DSA functions less as a safety framework and more as a censorship weapon designed to crush free speech. If Europe chooses stagnation over freedom, the outcome here is very clear: the US becomes an even more attractive space for innovation and freedom.</p>

<p>We must note that the EU's Grok investigation comes shortly after Europe plans to launch its own X-like social media platform called ""W,"" a subsidiary of Swedish climate media firm We Don't Have Time.</p>
